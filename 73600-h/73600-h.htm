<p class='c009'>Compliments are of various kinds.
It is not always necessary that they
should assume a laudatory form—they
may be conveyed quite as powerfully
through the medium of abuse.
Some men there are whose eulogy is
in itself a disgrace. Few would have
cared to see their characters upheld in
the columns of the <cite>Age</cite> or the <cite>Satirist</cite>—fewer
still would like to hear a
panegyric on their morals delivered
from a hustings by the lips of Mr
Reynolds. If we had to choose between
total obscurity, and a reputation
founded only upon the testimony
of Mr Cobden, we should not, for one
moment, hesitate to embrace the first
alternative. To be designated in the
polite circle of a sporting tavern as a
“nobby cove,” or a “real swell,” is
not, according to our ideas, a high
object of ambition; and we should
feel somewhat dubious of the real
character of the individual whose
praise was in the mouths of all the
cabmen.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the contrary, there can be no
doubt that abuse proceeding from certain
quarters is in itself a considerable
recommendation, and may even be
matter of pride to the party who is
made the subject of it. The just
Aristides never experienced a thrill
of more agreeable complacency than
when, at the request of the illiterate
Athenian, he wrote his own name on
the ostracising shell. We may rely
upon it that Coriolanus felt far more
gratified than incensed when the howling
and hooting of the plebeians enabled
him to deliver his stinging
diatribe, and to express the intensity
of his scorn. Virgil regarded the low
ribaldry of Mævius as a direct acknowledgment
of his literary accomplishments;
and Cicero in one of his
speeches expresses himself as being
under obligations to a notorious blackguard,
who had selected him as the
object of his attacks.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Disraeli, we think, lies under
similar obligations, though the author
of the book before us is simply an
ineffable blockhead. Mean, however,
as are his abilities, he has certainly
contrived to strike out a literary
novelty; though it may be doubted
whether his example, if followed by
men of average intellect, would tend
to the improvement or increase the
delights of society. In the pages of
a review or the columns of a magazine,
considerable freedom is used in discussing
the merits of eminent living
literary or political characters. Such
criticisms or sketches are, no doubt,
often tinted with party colours—are
sometimes rather severe—but are
rarely, if ever, scurrilous. But we
do not remember any instance parallel
to this, where a writer has selected
for his subject an eminent living character,
and has proceeded with deliberate,
though most dull malignity,
to rake up every particular of his life
which he dared to touch upon, to
gather every scrap which he either
has or is supposed to have written
from the years of his nonage upwards,
and then to lay before the public,
under the title of a biography, a ponderous
volume of no fewer than 646
pages. Should this example be followed,
and the practice become general,
it appears to us that there will be
strong necessity for revising the law
of libel. We have grave doubts
whether, under any circumstances,
one man is entitled to take so gross a
liberty with another. If each of us
were to sit down and compile biographies
of his living neighbours, this
would be no world to live in. Either
there would be an enormous increase
of actions for defamation, or the cudgel,
horse-whip, and pistol, would be
brought into immediate requisition.
Let us, however, concede that party
animosity, personal antipathy, or private
hatred may, either singly or collectively,
be held to justify the perpetration
of such an outrage—let us
suppose that there is such an accumulation
of black bile and venom in the
interior of the unhappy human reptile
that he must either give vent to it or
be suffocated—he is at least bound to
put his name on the title-page, so
that the world may know what manner
of man the deliberate accuser is.
For aught we are told to the contrary,
this volume may have been written by
Jack Ketch or one of his subordinate
assistants. Evidently it is not
written by one who possesses the
ordinary feelings of a gentleman,
though it is possible that he may
move in good society, bear a respectable
name, and be regarded by
veteran red-tapists as a young man
of considerable promise. He is the
counterpart of Randal Leslie in <cite>My
Novel</cite>—cold, selfish, and malignant,
without a spark of enthusiasm or a
generous thought in his whole composition.
Envy is the grand passion
of his mind; and, in this case, hatred
co-operates with envy. The object of
this book is to run down Mr Disraeli
on all points; to exhibit him as an
impostor in politics, a quack in literature,
a Maw-worm in religion, and
a hypocrite in morals. We defy any
one to peruse twenty pages of the
work without being convinced that
such was the intention of the author
of <cite>Disraeli, a Biography</cite>; and yet the
skulking creature has not courage
enough to show himself openly. He
even tries to assume a disguise so as
to deceive those who might otherwise
have traced him to his hole. “Conscious,”
says the cockatrice, “of no
motive but the public good, with
little to hope or fear from any political
party, strongly attached to principles,
but indulgent to mere opinions,
neither Whig nor Tory, but a respecter
both of the sincere Conservative
and the sincere Liberal, I have
no dread of the partisan’s malice.”
Mercy on us! who can this very
mysterious person be? “No motive
but the public good!”—“little to
hope or fear from any political party!”—“neither
Whig nor Tory!”—what
sort of a politician is this?  He
butters Mr Gladstone, he butters
Lord John Russell, he butters Lord
Palmerston, he butters Mr Hume—his
benevolence to every one except
Mr Disraeli is quite marvellous—but
more especially doth he laud and
magnify the men who are now in
power. “One of the humblest individuals
of this great empire has
thought it necessary to enter his protest
against this new system of morality,
which threatens to become
generally prevalent!” Humility!—morality!—Brave
words, Mr Randal
Leslie—but it really was not worth
while to add such hypocrisy to your
other sins. We know you a great
deal better than you suppose; and
your own past history, insignificant
though you are, has been too politically
profligate to escape reprobation.
You say you are neither Whig nor
Tory, and, for once in your life, you
speak the truth. But you were a
Tory, and you became a Whig, and
you are now a placeman; and you
would hold that place of yours as
readily under Mr Cobden as under
Lord Aberdeen. You were once a
Peelite, but you had not even the
decency to wait for the fortunes of
your chiefs. You lusted after office,
and took the bribe the instant it was
tendered by the Whigs; and in consequence
you are universally looked
upon and distrusted as the most
venal, selfish, and unprincipled young
man of your generation. It would
indeed be absurd in you to entertain
any “dread of the partisan’s malice.”
You have placed yourself in such a
position that you may defy malice of
any kind. Your career, though obscure,
has been so contemptible that
your bitterest enemy could not make
you seem worse than you were. It
must, however, be allowed that you
have materially added to your infamy
by the present publication.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have thought it our duty, at
the outset, to make these stringent
remarks, not because this writer has
selected Mr Disraeli as the object of
his attack, but because we altogether
disapprove of, and abominate, this
style of literary warfare. It is, thank
heaven, as yet uncommon among us;
and the best way of preventing its
occurrence is to make an example of
the caitiff who has introduced it. The
idea, however, is not altogether original.
It was engendered in Holywell
Street; from which Paphian locality,
as we are given to understand,
various works, professing to be “Private
Histories,” and “Secret Memoirs”
of eminent living characters,
were formerly issued; and this writer,
being no doubt familiar with that sort
of literature, has thought proper to
extend the range of his license. We
have, all of us, a decided interest in
maintaining the respectability of controversy.
A public career does indeed
render men very amenable to
criticism and comment; and it hardly
can be said that there is anything unfair
in contrasting public professions
and public acts. A statesman, or
even a less distinguished politician,
must be prepared to hear his former
opinions set against those which he
now enunciates, and he may even
consider it his duty elaborately to
vindicate the change. But to compile
biographies of living men—mixing
up, as in this case, their mere literary
effusions with their political lives, and
attempting, by distortion and base
inuendo, to render them contemptible
in the eyes of the public—is an outrage
on common decency, and must
excite universal scorn and disgust.</p>

<p class='c010'>The moral perceptions of the man
who could write a book like this
must, of course, be very weak; nevertheless,
it is evident that even his
conscience gave him an occasional
twinge, by way of reminding him of
the extreme dastardliness of his conduct.
He could not but be aware
that no honourable or chivalrous opponent
of Mr Disraeli could read this
tissue of malignity without experiencing
a sensation of loathing; and,
therefore, he has attempted, at the
very outset, to vindicate himself, by
representing Mr Disraeli as entitled
to no quarter or courtesy, on account
of his addiction to personality and
satire. It may be as well to take
down his own words, because we
shall presently have occasion to make
a few observations connected with
this charge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I admit fully that, if any man be
entirely destitute of all claim to indulgence,
it is the subject of this biography.
Personality is his mighty weapon, which
he has used like a gladiator whose only
object is, at all events, to inflict a deadly
wound upon his adversary, and not like
a chivalrous knight, who will at any
risk obey the laws of the tournament.
Mr Disraeli has been a true political
Ishmael. His hand has been raised
against every one. He has even run
amuck, like the wild Indian.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who can answer a political novel?
Libels the most scandalous may be insinuated,
the best and wisest men may
be represented as odious, the purest intentions
and most devoted patriotism
may be maligned, under the outline of a
fictitious character. The personal satirist
is truly the pest of society, and any
method might be considered justifiable
by which he could be hunted down. It
would, therefore, seem only a kind of
justice to mete out to Mr Disraeli the
same measure which he has meted out to
others. As he has ever used the dagger
and the bowl, why, it may be asked,
should not the deadly chalice be presented
back to him, and enforced by the
same pointed weapon? This may be
unanswerable; yet I hold that no generous
man would encounter an ungenerous
one with his own malice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Why not, Randal? If what you
say regarding Mr Disraeli be true,
you are perfectly entitled to encounter
him with his own weapons. You
complain of his having written political
novels, in which certain characters,
whom you regard as sublime and
pure, are represented in a different
light. Well, then, do you write a
novel of the same kind, showing up
Mr Disraeli under a fictitious name,
and we shall review it with all the
pleasure in the world. If it is clever,
sparkling, and original, you shall not
want laudation. But you know very
well that you could as soon swim the
Hellespont as compose two readable
chapters of a novel—that you have
not enough of invention to devise a
plot, or of imagination to shadow
forth a character; and, therefore, you
are pleased to assume the magnanimous,
and to drivel about the dagger
and the bowl. No one who reads
your book will believe that you would
abstain from the use of any weapon
which you could wield against Mr
Disraeli—(how should he, when you
glide before us as a masked assassin?)—but
he will be at no loss to divine
the reason why you decline an encounter
of wit. We are perfectly
sincere when we say that your intense
dulness ought in some measure to be
accepted as an extenuation for your
malevolence, for you have not art
enough to disguise or conceal the
hatred which is rankling in your
breast.</p>

<p class='c010'>But let us examine a little more
narrowly into the charge preferred
against Mr Disraeli. It is said that
personality is his weapon, which he
has used like a gladiator; and we
understand the averment to be that
both his political speeches and his
literary works display this tendency.
In considering this matter, it will be
proper to separate the two characters,
and look first to the politician, and
afterwards to the novelist.</p>

<p class='c010'>We shall at once admit that, in the
House of Commons, Mr Disraeli is
feared as an antagonist. He possesses
vast power of satire, a ready wit, and
has a thorough confidence and reliance
in his own resources. He has besides
an intense contempt for that kind of
cant in which it formerly was the
fashion to indulge—for the solemn
airs of pompous mediocrity, and for
the official jargon and conventional
hypocrisies of the Treasury bench.
When, in 1846, the late Sir Robert
Peel abandoned the cause of that
party of which he was the accredited
leader, he naturally became the object
of unsparing criticism and attack.
But his offence was a very grave one.
It fully justified the taunt of Mr Disraeli,
which this writer affects to consider
as remarkably offensive, that,
“like the Turkish admiral who, during
the war in the Levant, had steered
his fleet into the port of the enemy,
Sir Robert Peel had undertaken to
fight for this cause, and now assumed
the right of following his own judgment.”
The comparison was certainly
not a flattering one to the Prime
Minister; but it had this recommendation
that it was strictly apposite,
and that no man could gainsay it. It
is the height of absurdity to maintain
that personality could be, or ought to
have been, excluded from the discussions
and debates that followed.
Why, it was Sir Robert Peel himself
who, by his extraordinary change
of policy, made this a personal question,
and brought it to a direct issue
between the betrayer and the betrayed.
Are we really to be told at the present
day that measures alone should be discussed
in the Houses of Parliament,
and that all commentary on the conduct
and previous career of statesmen
ought to be avoided? Are we to be
allowed no latitude of reference to
former speeches—no allusion to former
protestations? Ought tergiversation
to be permitted to pass without notice
or censure—ought duplicity to escape
exposure? If not, we boldly ask in
what respect Mr Disraeli has sinned
so grievously as to merit the reproach
of this Tartuffe? It may be said, indeed,
that he pushed his resentment
of the unparalleled betrayal too far;
and we daresay, now that years have
intervened, he may himself regret the
occasional acrimony of his remarks.
That is the natural feeling of every
generous-minded man who has been
compelled to take an active share in
public discussion; for it is impossible
to restrain at all times the excited
passions, and sometimes the hour for
calm retrospection does not arrive,
until the occasion of the original
offence has passed into matter of
history. Mr Macaulay, in the preface
to the collected edition of his
speeches, says with reference to this
very point: “I should not willingly
have revived, in the quiet times in
which we are so happy as to live, the
memory of those fierce contentions in
which so many years of my public life
were passed. Many expressions which,
when society was convulsed by political
dissension, and when the foundations
of government were shaking,
were heard by an excited audience
with sympathy and applause, may,
now that the passions of all parties
have subsided, be thought intemperate
and acrimonious. It was especially
painful to me to find myself under
the necessity of recalling to my own
recollection, and to the recollection of
others, the keen encounters which
took place between the late Sir Robert
Peel and myself.” So it will ever be
with the generous and high-spirited;
but it does not follow therefrom that
the attacks were not deserved. Of
course such cold toads as Mr Randal
Leslie cannot be expected to understand
or appreciate the feeling either
of indignation or of regret. Having
no sympathy but for self, and possessing
no clear discernment of the
difference between right and wrong,
between candour and duplicity—having
been trained from their boyhood
upwards to believe that falsehood,
trickery, and deceit, are component
and necessary qualities of statesmanship—they,
naturally enough, stand
aghast at the audacity which tore the
veil from organised hypocrisies, and
hate the exposer with a hatred more
enduring than the love of woman.
Hence this cant about personality,
which they talk of as if it were a new
element in political discussion. Now,
the fact is, that no political discussion
ever was conducted, or ever will be
conducted, without personality. You
cannot separate the idea from the
man, the argument from him who
uses it. The first orator of antiquity,
Demosthenes, was personal to a degree
never yet paralleled, as every one who
has read his Philippics must allow.
In this he was imitated by Cicero,
whose stinging invectives, as witness
the speeches against Catiline
and Verres, have commanded the admiration
of the world. Chatham’s first
speech in the House of Commons was
a purely personal one, no doubt provoked
by his antagonist, but almost
witheringly severe. Canning and
Brougham dealt largely both in satire
and personality—indeed, it would
hardly be possible to find a speech of
the latter orator free from a strong
infusion of that quality which the
moral Randal deplores. In our own
time no great question has been discussed
without personality; and for
this reason, that it would be impossible
to discuss it otherwise. No
doubt personality may sometimes be
carried greatly too far. When Lord
John Russell taunted Lord George
Bentinck with his former addiction
to the turf, intending to convey thereby
an unworthy inuendo, he committed
a serious fault, because he violated
gentlemanly decorum. When
the late Sir Robert Peel accused Mr
Cobden of a desire to have him assassinated,
he was not only ultra-personal,
but outrageously and unpardonably
unjust. When the same
statesman could find no better answer
to Mr Disraeli, than a charge that
the latter had at one time been willing
to hold office under him, he was,
besides being directly personal, guilty
of a breach of confidence. We are
aware it is the fashion among the
present Ministry to protest against
personalities. Let us ask whether it
was his administrative talent or his
practice in personal warfare that elevated
Mr Bernal Osborne to the post
of Secretary to the Admiralty?
Ministers are far from objecting to a
Spartacus, when they know they may
reckon on his assistance—it is only
when a keen weapon is flashing on
the other side that they think it
necessary to make an outcry. Party
warfare we cannot expect to see an
end of; but, in the name of common
sense, let us at least eschew humbug.
The House of Commons is, even now,
a queer assembly, and Lord John
Russell may make it worse; still, let
us believe that the members collectively
entertain that ordinary sense of
propriety that they will not permit
anything to be uttered within the
walls of St Stephens, which calls for
direct reprobation, without immediate
challenge, and without censure, if an
apology is not made for the intemperance.
One of the principal duties
of the Speaker is to repress and check
the use of unparliamentary language.
If any accusation, not falling under
that restriction, is preferred, the members
of the House are the judges of
its propriety, and may be expected,
in the aggregate, to enforce the rules
which govern the conduct of gentlemen.
It is, therefore, most gross impertinence
in Mr Randal Leslie to
challenge what Parliament has not
challenged. Mr Disraeli’s present
position, as the leader of the largest
independent, and most influential section
of the House of Commons, is the
best answer to the insinuations of this
contemptible little snake, who, we
apprehend, will not receive, from his
political superiors, the meed of gratitude
which he expected for his present
unfortunate attempt. It is the misfortune
of your Randal Leslies, that
they never can, even by blundering,
stumble on the right path. Set them
to defend in writing some particular
line of policy, and the first six pages
of their lucubrations will convince the
impartial reader that they are advocating
something unsound or untrue,
by dint of their unnecessary affectation
of candour. Set them to
attack an opponent, and they fail;
because they cannot descry the points
upon which he is really vulnerable,
and because they think indiscriminate
abuse is more effective than artistic
criticism, of which latter branch of
accomplishment they are wholly incapable.
This lad has not even the
talent to malign with plausibility.
He calls Mr Disraeli “a true political
Ishmael.” What does the blockhead
mean? Does he not know that the
individual whom he denominates Ishmael,
is at this moment at the head
of the most powerful separate party
in the British House of Commons?</p>

<p class='c010'>In justice to the leading members
of the Coalition Cabinet, we shall state
our opinion, (not altogether unfortified
by certain rumours which have
reached us), that they were unaware
of this singularly silly attempt, on the
part of one of their subordinates, to
attack an eminent character in opposition,
until the fool launched it
from the press before a disgusted
public. Ill-judging Randal Leslie
conceived that his work would make
a grand political sensation; so, after
the manner of his kind, he kept
his secret to himself, and worked
like a perfect galley-slave, or like a
thorough scavenger, at his vocation.
Whatever Mr Disraeli had said or
written on politics, or any subject
trenching upon politics, from the
period of his first publication down
to his last parliamentary speech,
Randal had read and noted; and the
poor knave at last concluded that he
had a good case to lay before the
public. And what does his political
case, by his own account, amount to?
Simply this: That Mr Disraeli, from
his very earliest years, has detested
and denounced the tenets of the Whig
party; and that he has always supported
the cause of the people—not
in the democratic, but in the real and
truthful sense of the word—against
the villanies of organised oppression,
and the rapacity of manufacturing
domination. But these things belong
rather to his literary than to his political
character. Randal thought he
had made a great hit in bringing them
forward. He must have been very
much amazed when an elder and more
sagacious colleague explained to him
that, instead of throwing dirt upon
the object of his enmity, he had unconsciously
been passing upon him a
high encomium, such as any statesman
might be proud of for his panegyric;
and that his work, if generally
read, would greatly tend to sap the
faith in present political combinations.
After all, how stand the facts? Ten
years ago Mr Disraeli, a member of
the Tory party, but not then greatly
distinguished as a politician, nor possessing
that influence which hereditary
rank and high connection give to
others, had the sagacity to discern
that Sir Robert Peel was not a safe
leader, and the courage to make the
avowal. Randal quotes his language
in 1844. “He had always acknowledged
that he was a party man. It
was the duty of a member of the
House of Commons to be a party
man. He, however, would only follow
a leader who was prepared to
lead.” No doubt the lips of many a
Tadpole and Taper curled with derision
at this audacious declaration of
contempt for constituted authority, on
the part of a young man, the tenor of
whose speeches they could not rightly
understand. He professed himself to
be a Tory, but he often uttered sentiments
which seemed to them strongly
to savour of Radicalism. He did not
scruple to avow his sympathy with
the labouring classes, his desire to see
them elevated and protected, and his
wish for the adoption of a more
genial, considerate, and paternal
course of legislation. He traced the
agitation for the Charter to the establishment
of the supremacy of a
middle-class government in the
country; and boldly announced his
opinion that this monarchy of the
middle classes might one day shake
our institutions and endanger the
throne. In particular he denounced
centralisation—a great and growing
evil, to which he attributed much
of the existing discontent. Such
views were of course unintelligible to
the Tadpoles and Tapers—men who
considered statesmanship a science
only in so far as it could insure
ascendancy to their party, and places
to themselves. There were then a
good many veteran Tadpoles and
Tapers; and Sir Robert Peel was
doing his best to educate a new generation
of them to supply inevitable
vacancies. Naturally enough they
regarded Mr Disraeli as a pure
visionary; but there were others upon
whom his argument and example were
not lost. Young men began to consider
whether, after all, they were
doing their duty by blindly submitting
themselves to party domination,
as rigid and exacting as the most
autocratic rule. They were desired,
under very severe penalties for rising
politicians, not to venture to think for
themselves, but to do as the minister
ordered. They were not to take up
their time in unravelling social questions—if
they wanted mental exercise,
let them serve on a railway committee.
There might be, and doubtless was, a
cry of distress and a wailing from
without—but the minister would see
to that, settle everything by an increase
of the police force, or perhaps
a coercion bill; and the Treasury
whip would give them due notice
when they were expected to vote.
In short, young members of Parliament
were then treated exactly as if
they had been children, incapable of
forming an opinion; and they were
told, in almost as many words, that
if they did not choose to submit
themselves to this dictation, the
doors of the Treasury would remain
closed against them for ever. The
effect of this insolence—for we can
give it no other name—was that
a considerable portion of the young
aristocracy rebelled. They would not
submit to such preposterous tyranny,
and they cared not a rush for any of
the Ministerial threats. They saw
that, in the country, there was distress—that
discontent and disaffection
were very rife—and that, in the very
heart of England, a large body of the
working population were absolutely
in a state of bondage. They could not
find it in their hearts to greet, with
exultation, the announcement of increased
exports, whilst every year
the condition of the producers seemed
to be becoming worse. Looking to the
state, they saw two great parties under
autocratic chiefs, bidding against each
other for popularity—that is, power—and
for office to their respective staffs,
without any real regard for the interest
or improvement of the masses.
That was not a spectacle likely to find
favour in the eyes of a young, ardent,
and generous-minded man; and accordingly
from that time we may date
the formation of another party, still
on the increase, and rapidly augmenting,
which, rejecting what was bad
in the old Toryism, but maintaining
its better principle—resolute to preserve
the constitution, but cordially
sympathising with the people—is preparing
to encounter, and will encounter
with success, the cold-blooded democracy
of Manchester, which would
destroy everything that is venerable,
noble, or dear to England, and establish
on the ruins a serfdom of Labour,
with Capital as the inexorable tyrant.
We do not say that Mr Disraeli is
to be regarded as the founder of
that party. Young men professing
conservative opinions were beginning
about that time to think independently
for themselves, and to doubt the
authenticity and soundness of tradition.
The young Whigs, who were
kept in much better order by their
seniors, stuck by their old political
breviary; but the young Tories would
not. They were ready, if occasion required,
to maintain to the death the
Monarchy, the House of Peers, and
the Church; but they could not, for
the lives of them, understand that it
was not their duty to investigate, and
if possible improve, the condition of
the working-classes. On the contrary,
they regarded that as a distinct moral
duty, in which they were resolved to
persevere, notwithstanding the advice
of their own political Gallios, or the
example of their opponents who were
always ready, when the people asked
for relief, to tender them a stone.
Mr Disraeli, however, has this credit,
that he was the first, in the House of
Commons, to free himself from a debasing
domination, and to assert his
absolute independence of the minister
in thought and deed. Of course he
was never forgiven by the autocrat,
nor will he be forgiven by the men
who still swear by their idol. But he
went on undauntedly, never fearing
to say his thought; and barely two
years had elapsed before the great
bulk of the Tory party—the Tapers
and Tadpoles excepted—had acknowledged
the justness of his estimate as
to the trustworthiness of their former
chief, and ranged themselves in opposition
to the late Sir Robert Peel.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is not our intention to pronounce
a panegyric upon Mr Disraeli. We
see no occasion for doing so, and we
doubt if he would care to hear one.
But we confess that the impudence of
this young whipper-snapper has somewhat
roused our bile. He reminds us
of a wretched curtailed messan whom
we once saw introduced into a drawing-room.
The creature, which, in
mercy to the future canine breed,
ought to have been drowned in the
days of its puppydom, went sniffing
about at the furniture, thrusting its
odious nose everywhere, and at last
committed sacrilege by lifting its leg
against a magnificent china jar. Of
course Nemesis was speedy. We had
the satisfaction of kicking the cur
from the upper landing to the lobby,
by a single pedal application; and,
beyond the hint gathered from a dolorous
howl, have no cognizance of its
after fate. Mr Disraeli’s present position
in the House of Commons is the
best possible answer to “one of the
humblest”—for which, read, meanest—“individuals
of this great empire.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randal, however, does not confine
himself to a review of Mr Disraeli’s
political career. He must needs—though
of all men the most unfitted
for the task, for he has no more notion
of literature than a Hottentot—attempt
to criticise him as an author.
Here he evidently thinks that he can
make out a strong case; and accordingly
he goes over, <em>seriatim</em>, the whole
of the publications to which Mr
Disraeli has set his name, and one or
two others which were not so authenticated.
At first sight it is not easy
to understand why he should have
given himself so much trouble. Mr
Disraeli’s earliest novel, <cite>Vivian Grey</cite>,
was written when the author was
about the age of two-and-twenty, and,
no doubt, to the critical eye, it has
many faults. But so have the early
productions of every master—not
only in language, but in painting and
all other branches of art,—yet we
forgive them all for the unmistakable
traces of real genius which are displayed.
That early novel of Mr
Disraeli, though produced so far back
as 1826, has never been forgotten.
It took its place at once as a decided
work of genius; and, as such, continued
to be read before the author
became a political character or celebrity.
And so it was, even in larger
measure, with his next work, <cite>Contarini
Fleming</cite>. Now, it is of some importance
to ask, <em>why</em> these books were
popular? They certainly could not
recommend themselves to the old,
as elaborate compositions, for they
showed a lack of worldly experience,
and sometimes bordered on extravagance.
But they recommended themselves
to the young, because they were
brimful of a youthful spirit; because
they expressed, better perhaps than
ever had been done before, the daring,
recklessness, and utter exuberance of
youth; and because even older men
recognised in them the distinct image
of passions which they had once entertained,
but from which they were divorced
for ever. Poor pitiful Randal,
who even in his boyhood does not
seem to have experienced a single
generous impulse, thinks that in these
juvenile pictures he can identify the
future politician. He says, “It is impossible,
in perusing the book, not to
connect Mr Disraeli with Contarini
Fleming;” and he then goes on
gravely to argue that many of the
positions in the romance are objectionable.
Because Mr Disraeli makes his
leading character talk extravagantly
when in love—as what boy under
such circumstances does not talk extravagantly?—we
are asked to believe
that the author is habitually addicted
to fustian! Because Contarini Fleming
is represented at the head of a
band of reckless collegians, who, inspired
by the “Robbers” of Schiller,
betake themselves to the woods, Randal
politely insinuates that Mr Disraeli
was intended by nature for a bandit!
He might just as well tell us that Miss
Jane Porter was intended for a Scottish
chief! Such absolute trash as
this is really below contempt; nor
would we have noticed it at all
except to show the animus of this
singularly paltry critic. We shall
make no further allusion to his commentary
on the early novels, beyond
remarking, that he crawls over every
page of <cite>Venetia</cite> and <cite>Henrietta Temple</cite>,
in the hope to leave upon them traces
of his ugly slime.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is, however, against the political
novels that Mr Randal Leslie chooses
principally to inveigh. That he regards
them as heterodox in doctrine
is not to be wondered at—that he
cannot discriminate between the
sportive and the real is the result
of his own narrow powers of comprehension.
But his chief cry, as we have
remarked before, is against personality,
and he thus favours us with his
ideas: “All men must execrate the
midnight stabber. And a midnight
stabber is a man who, in a work of
fiction, endeavours to make a fictitious
character stand for a real one,
and attributes to it any vices he
pleases. Nothing can be more unfair;
nothing can be more reprehensible.
Against such a system of
attack even the virtues of a Socrates
are no protection,” &#38;c. We see no
occasion for dragging Socrates into
the discussion. Those twin sons of
Sophroniscus, Tadpole and Taper,
are quite sufficient for our purpose
in discussing this point of literary
personality. We are therefore given
to understand by Mr Leslie, that it
is utterly unjustifiable to display, in
a work of fiction, any character corresponding
to a real one. That, certainly,
is a broad enough proposition.
According to this view, Virgil was a
midnight stabber, because it is notorious
that the characters in the Eneid
were intended to represent eminent
personages of Rome; and all of them
were not flatteringly portrayed—as,
for instance, Drances, who stands for
Cicero. Spenser was a midnight
stabber, in respect of Duessa, intended
for Mary Queen of Scots. Shakespeare
was a midnight stabber, in
respect of Justice Shallow, the eidolon
of Sir Thomas Lucy. Dryden was an
irreclaimable bravo; witness his Absalom
and Achitophel. We are afraid
that even Pope must wear the badge
of the poniard. Very few of our
deceased, and scarce one of our living
novelists, can escape the charge of
satire and personality. If a man is
writing about things of the present
day, he must, perforce, take his
characters from the men who move
around him, else he will produce no
true picture. Both Dickens and
Thackeray draw from life, and their
sketches are easily recognisable.
There are certain characters in Mr
Warren’s <cite>Ten Thousand A-Year</cite>,
which we apprehend nobody can
mistake. In depicting, for example,
the House of Commons, would it be
correct to paint that assembly, not
as it is, but as what it might be, if
a total change were made in its
members? If a literary man has
occasion, in a work of fiction, to
sketch the Treasury Bench, must he
necessarily leave out the principal
figures which give interest to that
Elysian locality? But is it really
true that Mr Disraeli has been so
excessively licentious in his personality?
Tadpoles he has drawn, no
doubt, and Tapers; but there are at
least two dozen gentlemen who have
equal right to appropriate those designations
to themselves. He has
given us two perfect types of a narrow-minded
class, but the class itself is numerous.
The originals of Coningsby
and Millbank, if there were any such,
are not likely to complain of their
treatment; and positively the only
objectionable instance of personality
which we can remember as occurring
in Mr Disraeli’s political novels, is
the character of Rigby. It is quite
possible that Mr Disraeli might, if
he chose, give a satisfactory explanation
of this departure from decorum;
for we are not of the number of those
who profess, like Mr Randal Leslie,
to think that it is unlawful to retaliate
with the same weapon which
has been used in assault. But the
truth is, we care very little about the
matter. Let us grant that this one
character of Rigby is objectionable—does
that justify this outrageous
howl about perpetual personalities?
Where are the personalities in Sybil
and Tancred? We may be very
dull, but we really cannot find them;
and yet we have perused both works
more than once with great pleasure.
Who are the leading political characters
whom Mr Disraeli is said to have
sketched for the purpose of misrepresenting
their motives? Has he given us
in his novels a sketch of Wellington,
of Peel, of Brougham, of Lord John
Russell, of Sir James Graham, of
O’Connell, of Cobden, or of Hume?
We never heard that alleged; and
yet we are told that his novels are
full of outrageous political libels!
Why, if he had intended to be politically
personal, he could not by possibility
have avoided introducing
some of these men, under feigned
names, seeing that they have all
played a conspicuous part in the
great drama of public life. He might,
we think, have introduced them, had
he so pleased, without any breach of
propriety; but it is enough, in dealing
with Mr Randal Leslie, to remark
that he has not done so, and
consequently the whole elaborate
structure of hypocrisy falls to the
ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may be said that it was not worth
our while to waste powder and shot
upon a jackdaw; nor, in all probability,
should we have done so, were
this the sole chatterer of his species.
But the splendid abilities and
political success of Mr Disraeli have
created for him a host of enemies,
who seem determined, at all hazards,
to run him down, and whose attacks
are not only malignant, but unintermitting.
Some of these may be regarded
simply as the ebullitions of
envy—the mutterings of discontent
against success. The feeling which
prompts such attacks is anything but
commendable; but we are inclined to
draw a distinction between that class
of writers, and another, whose enmity
to Mr Disraeli may be traced to more
personal motives. The former may,
perhaps, have no absolute dislike to
the man whom they are endeavouring
to decry. They assail him because he
has risen so much and so swiftly
above their social level; and if he
were to experience a reverse, their
feeling towards him would probably
change. Theirs is just the sentiment of
vulgar radicalism—that which stimulates
demagogues to attack the Church
and the aristocracy. Men of the literary
profession are very liable to such influences,
more especially when one of
their number passes into another
sphere of distinction. So long as Mr
Disraeli confined himself to literary
pursuits, he might be regarded and
dealt with as one of themselves: it
was his political career, and his accession
to office as a Cabinet Minister,
which made the gap between him and
the literary multitude. It is much to
be regretted, for the sake of literature
itself, that any such demonstrations
of jealousy should be exhibited, but
we fear there is no remedy for it.
Other times, besides our own, furnish
us with examples in abundance of
this kind of unworthy detraction,
which, however, may not be tinged
with absolute personal malice.</p>

<p class='c010'>The author of this volume has nothing
in common with the writers to
whom we have just alluded. In the
first place, he has no pretensions
whatever to be considered as a literary
man. His style is bald and bad;
he is wholly unpractised in criticism;
and he commits the egregious blunder
of dealing in indiscriminate abuse.
Notwithstanding all our admiration
for Mr Disraeli, we are bound to
admit that some of his novels afford
ample scope for criticism; and that a
witty and competent reviewer could
easily, and with perfect fairness, write
an amusing article on the subject. More
than one excellent imitation of Mr Disraeli’s
peculiar style has appeared in
the periodicals; and we have no doubt
that even the author of <cite>Coningsby</cite> enjoyed
a hearty laugh over the facetious
parodies of <cite>Punch</cite>. There is no
kind of malice in the preparation or
issuing of squibs like these. We
should all of us become a great deal
too dull and solemn without them;
and they contribute to the public
amusement without giving annoyance
to any one. But Randal Leslie is
such an absolute bungler that he is
not contented with selecting the weak
points in Mr Disraeli’s works, but tries
to depreciate those very excellencies
and beauties which have elevated
him in the eyes of the public. He
cannot bear to think that Mr Disraeli
should have credit for having written
even a single interesting chapter, and
therefore he keeps battering at the
fabric of his fame, like a billy-goat
butting at a wall. Had Mr Randal
Leslie possessed a little more real
knowledge of the world, or had his
conceit been but one degree less than
it is, he would have paused before entering
the literary and critical arena.
He can talk glibly enough about gladiators—was
he not aware that a certain
degree of training is required, before
a literary man becomes used to the
practice of his art? Apparently not;
for anything so utterly contemptible,
in the shape of criticism, it never was
our fortune to peruse. We conclude,
therefore, that whatever may have
been the nature of the other “private
griefs” which stimulated this wretched
onslaught on Mr Disraeli, literary jealousy
was not among the number. The
frog may wish to emulate the dimensions
of the ox; but not even Esop
has ventured to represent it as emulous
of the caroling of the lark.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have no hesitation in stating
our belief, that a certain party in the
State, to whom Mr Disraeli is peculiarly
obnoxious, has addressed itself
deliberately to the task, through its
organs, of running him down. The
Whigs, of course, regard him with no
favour, for he has always been their
determined opponent; but we have
no reason whatever to suppose that
their hostility would be carried so far
as to induce them to join in so very
unworthy a conspiracy. But to the
Peelites he has given mortal umbrage.
They cannot forget that he
was the man who first challenged the
despotic authority of their chief in the
House of Commons, and set an example
of independence in thought and
action to others of the Tory party.
They cannot forget the conflicts in
which he was personally engaged with
their leader; and they cannot forgive
him for the havoc which he made in
the ranks of the pseudo-Conservatives.
If he and others had chosen to
stifle their convictions, to lay aside
all considerations of honour and consistency,
to submit to mysterious
but imperative dictation, and to become
the passive tools of an autocratic
minister, the Conservatives might still
have been in power, and the red-tapists
in possession of their offices.
Not one of the latter class but feels
himself personally injured. The
Tapers and Tadpoles had been so
long accustomed to the advent of
quarter-day, that they regarded their
places almost in the light of patrimonial
possessions; and bitter indeed
was their hatred of the man
who had assisted to eject them from
their Goshen. Besides this, their
vanity, of which they were not without
a large share, was sorely wounded
by the manner in which they were
exhibited to the public view, and
more so by the intense relish with
which the sketches were received.
Mr Disraeli never made so happy a
hit as in his portraiture of these
small, bustling, self-sufficient, and
narrow-minded officials, with their
ridiculous notions about party watchwords,
political combinations, backstairs
influence, and so forth; nor
was there ever a more terse or felicitous
description of the then existing
Government, than that which he has put
into the mouth of Taper:—“A sound
Conservative government—I understand:
Tory men and Whig measures.”
These things belong to the
past. They are, however, intelligible
reasons for the rancour which the
remnants of the Peel party, even when
allied with the Whigs in power, exhibit
towards Mr Disraeli; and nothing
since has occurred to mitigate
the acerbity of that feeling. But there
are weighty considerations applicable
to the future. The Aberdeen Cabinet
is composed of such heterogeneous
materials that it cannot be expected
to hold long together. Even now
there is dissension within it; and, but
for the expectation of an immediate
and inveterate war, which renders the
idea of a change of government distasteful
to every one, men would
consider it as doomed. In fact, the
alliance has never been other than
a hollow one, and there is no real
cordiality or confidence among the
chiefs. The Whigs are already looking
in the direction of the Radicals;
the Peelites would very gladly gain
the confidence of the country gentlemen.
They believe it not impossible
even yet, by making certain sacrifices
and concessions, to reconstruct the
Conservative party; but Mr Disraeli
is the obstacle, and their hatred of
him is even greater than their love of
office. They would, in 1852, have
opened a negotiation, provided he had
been excluded; and they entertain
the same views in 1854. It is evident
that Lord Aberdeen cannot long remain
as Premier. He is anything
but personally popular; he is now
well advanced in years; and his conduct
in the Eastern question has not
raised him in the estimation of the
country. But then, failing him, who
is to be the leader of the Peelites in
the House of Lords? Not certainly
the Duke of Newcastle, who has
neither temper nor ability for that
duty; and they have no one else to
put forward. Gladly would they
serve under Lord Derby; but the
same Cabinet cannot hold Mr Disraeli
and Mr Gladstone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let them do their worst. It is not
by publications of this kind, or unscrupulous
newspaper invectives, that
they will accomplish their object.
Even the critic who has taken this
book as a text for his commentary in
the <cite>Times</cite>, is constrained to acknowledge
that the author has sate down
“to accumulate upon the head of
his living victim all the dislike, malevolence,
and disgust he can get together
in 650 octavo pages.” We must
say that it never was our lot to peruse
a more extraordinary article than that
which we now refer to. The critic does
not even think it necessary to affect
that he cares for public morality. He
dislikes the Protectionists, whose general
ability he doubts, as much as
he abhors their tenets; and he thinks
that Mr Disraeli ought to have left
their camp in 1848, immediately after
the death of Lord George Bentinck.
We confess that we were at first a
good deal startled at this proposition,
inasmuch as the course of conduct
which is here indicated would have
laid Mr Disraeli open to such charges
of perfidy as no honourable man could
endure; but, on looking a little further,
we began to see the drift of these
observations. There are two detachments
of mischief-makers at work—the
object of the one being to disgust
the Tory party with Mr Disraeli; that
of the other being to disgust Mr Disraeli
with his party. We think it
right, out of sheer regard for ethics,
to quote a sentence or two from the
critical article in the <cite>Times</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“For weeks,” says the critic, referring
to the position of Mr Disraeli
in 1848, “did he suffer mortification,
insult, and ingratitude from the Protectionist
party, with Lord Derby at
its head; such as must have roused a
nobler soul to self-respect, and stung
it with a consciousness of intolerable
wrong. What if, at that period of
consummate baseness and unblushing
insolence, Mr Disraeli had stood apart
from the conspirators, and taken an
independent place in the arena which
he had already made his own! Does
he believe that the good-will of his
countrymen would have been wanting
to him at that trying hour, and that
the sympathies of Whig and Tory
would not have sustained him in
the crisis? He will never recover
the consequences of the fault then
committed. He stooped low as the
ground to conquer, and he failed. He
might have vanquished nobly, and
held his head erect. By consenting
to act with men who did not hesitate
to let him feel how much they despised
him, he has, indeed, tasted the sweets
of office, and for a season held the
reins of power. But where is he now?
Where might he have been, had he
proudly taken his seat in 1848, aloof
from the false allies who had no belief
in his earnestness, no satisfaction in
his company, and who hurled their
contempt in his teeth?”</p>

<p class='c010'>It requires more than one perusal
before the full meaning of this passage
can be comprehended. The critic
first informs us, with a most suspicious
degree of circumstantiality as to
details, that, after the death of Lord
George Bentinck, there was some indisposition
to intrust the leadership of
the Protectionist party in the House
of Commons to Mr Disraeli, and then
argues that he ought to have left
them at once and for ever! Beautiful,
indeed, are the notions of morality
and honour which are here inculcated!</p>

<p class='c010'>But how comes the writer in the
<cite>Times</cite> to be so intimately acquainted
with the secret councils of the Protectionist
party, whom in the aggregate
he sneers at, terms “conspirators,” and
accuses of “consummate baseness and
unblushing insolence?” What does he
know, more than other determined
supporters of Sir Robert Peel, of what
was passing in the opposite camp? He
tells us, speaking of 1845, that “in
England the injustice of the Corn
Laws is felt at every hearth. Sir
Robert Peel seizes the opportunity to
repair some of the errors of his former
life, and to establish his name for ever
in the grateful recollection of his
countrymen.” The man who wrote
these words never could have had any
trafficking with the Protectionists;
he must have abhorred them throughout;
and yet the curious thing is, that
he knows, or pretends to know, a
great deal more about them than an
enemy could possibly have done.
For example, he says, in reference to
the alleged unwillingness, on the part
of the Protectionists, to be led by Mr
Disraeli, that “almost in as many
words Lord Derby, then Lord Stanley,
condescended to convey the intelligence
to the gifted subaltern, and to
inform him that, notwithstanding the
transcendent services he had rendered,
he had not respectability enough
for the place of honour he had earned.”
This is either false or true. If false,
it is the most unblushing fiction we
ever remember to have met with; if
true, we should like very much to
know how the writer came by his information.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not less remarkable is the intimate
knowledge which the critic affects of
Mr Disraeli’s private character. That
he dislikes him is very evident. He
describes him as “Genius without
Conscience;” says “he has not a bad
heart—he has no heart at all;” that
he “will stand before posterity as the
great political infidel of his age, as
one who believed in nothing but himself;”
and a great deal to the same
purpose. He denounces him as inconsistent;
and yet, in the same breath,
blames him for not having abandoned
his party on the impulse of a sudden
pique. If Iago were alive and a
critic, we should expect from him
just such an article as that which
appeared in the <cite>Times</cite>.</p>

<p class='c010'>We end as we began. In this
wicked and envious little world of
ours, no man of any note can hope to
escape without abuse, which may
be formidable or not, according to
the quarter from which it comes, and
the motives which called it forth.
If more than the share commonly
set apart for public men has fallen
upon Mr Disraeli, he may comfort
himself with the reflection that there
is but one feeling on the part of the
public with regard to the conduct
of his assailants; and we are greatly
mistaken if, by this time, the author
of the <cite>Literary and Political Biography</cite>
does not wish, in his secret
heart, that he had never addressed
himself to his dirty task. As for
other attacks, he is certainly liable to
these, both as a party leader and as
an ex-minister. No one knows better
than Mr Disraeli that enmities may
sometimes arise from peculiar causes.
Of this, indeed, he has given us, in
one of his earlier fictions, a very apt
illustration, when he makes Ixion
say: “I remember we had a confounded
poet at Larissa, who proved
my family lived before the Deluge,
and asked me for a pension. I refused
him, and then he wrote an epigram
asserting that I sprang from the veritable
stones thrown by Deucalion and
Pyrrha at the repeopling of the earth,
and retained all the properties of my
ancestors!”</p>

<h3 class='c013'>PART IV.—CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p class='c014'>“Eh, Menie, are you sure yon’s
London?”</p>

<p class='c010'>So asked little July Home standing
under the shadow of the elm-trees,
and looking out upon the sea of city
smoke, with great St Paul’s looming
through its dimness. July did not
quite understand how she could be
said to be near London, so long as
she stood upon the green sod, and saw
above her the kindly sky. “There’s
no very mony houses hereaway,” said
the innocent July; “there’s mair in
Dumfries, Menie—and this is just a
fine green park, and here’s trees—are
you sure yon’s London?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, it’s London.” Very differently
they looked at it;—the one with
the marvelling eyes of a child, ready
to believe all wonders of that mysterious
place, supreme among the nations,
which was rather a superb individual
personage from among the
Arabian genii than a collection of
human streets and houses, full of the
usual weaknesses of humankind; the
other with the dreamy gaze of a woman,
pondering in her heart over the
scene of her fate.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And Randall’s yonder, and Johnnie
Lithgow?” said July. “I would just
like to ken where; Menie, you’ve been
down yonder in the town—where will
Johnnie and our Randall be? Mrs
Wellwood down in Kirklands bade
me ask Randall if he knew a cousin
of hers, Peter Scott, that lives in London;
but nobody could ken a’ the
folk, Menie, in such a muckle town.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear Miss July, muckle is an
ugly word,” said Miss Annie Laurie,
“and you must observe how nicely
your brother and his friend speak—quite
marvellous for self-educated
young men—and even Menie here is
very well. You must not say muckle,
my love.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was because I meant to say
very big,” said July with a great blush,
holding down her head and speaking
in a whisper. July had thrown
many a wandering glance already
at Miss Annie, speculating whether to
call her the old lady or the young
lady, and listening with reverential
curiosity to all she said; for July
thought “She—the lady,” was very
kind to call her my dear and my love
so soon, and to kiss her when she went
away wearied, on her first evening at
Heathbank, to rest; though July could
never be sure about Miss Annie, and
marvelled much that Menie Laurie
should dare to call any one in such
ringlets and such gowns, aunt.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will soon learn better, my
dear little girl,” said the gracious
Miss Annie, “and you must just be
content to continue a little girl while
you are here, and take a lesson now
and then, you know; and above all,
my darling, you must take care not
to fall in love with this young man
whom you speak of so familiarly. He
must not be Johnnie any more, but
only Mr Lithgow, your brother’s friend
and ours—for I cannot have both my
young ladies falling in love.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Me!” July’s light little frame
trembled all over, her soft hair fell
down upon her neck. “It never will
stay up,” murmured July, with eager
deprecation, as Miss Annie’s eye fell
upon the silky uncurled locks; but it
was only shamefacedness and embarrassment
which made July notice the
descent of her hair—for July was
trembling with a little thrill of fear
and wonder and curiosity. Was it possible,
then, that little July had come
to sufficient years to be capable of
falling in love?—and, in spite of herself,
July thought again upon Johnnie
Lithgow, and marvelled innocently,
though with a blush, whether he
“minded” her as she minded him.</p>

<p class='c010'>But July could not understand the
strange abstraction which had fallen
upon her friend—the dreamy eye, the
vacant look, the long intervals of
silence. Menie Laurie of Burnside
had known nothing of all this new-come
gravity, and July’s wistful look
had already begun to follow those
wandering eyes of hers—to follow
them away through the daylight, and
into the dark, wondering—wondering—what
it was that Menie sought to see.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jenny is busied in the remote regions
of the kitchen at this present
moment, delivering a lecture, very
sharp, and marked with some excitement,
to Miss Annie Laurie’s kitchen
maid, who is by no means an ornamental
person, and for that and many
other reasons is a perpetual grief to
Miss Annie’s heart—so Jenny is happily
spared the provocation of beholding
the new visitor who has entered
the portals of Heathbank. For a portentous
shawl, heavy as a thundercloud,
a gown lurid as the lightning
escaping from under its shade, and a
new bonnet grim with gentility, are
making their way round the little lawn,
concealing from expectant eyes the
slight person and small well-formed
head, with its short matted crop of
curls, which distinguish Johnnie Lithgow.
Johnnie, good fellow, does not
think his sister the most suitable visitor
in the world to the Laurie household;
but Johnnie would not, for more
wealth than he can reckon, put slight
upon his sister even in idea—so Miss
Annie Laurie’s Maria announces Miss
Panton at the door of Miss Annie
Laurie’s drawing-room, and Nelly,
where she failed to come as a servant,
is introduced as a guest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank’ye, mem,” said Nelly. “I
like London very weel so far as I’ve
seen it—but it’s a muckle place, I
dinna doubt, no to be lookit through
in a day—and I’m aye fleyed to lose
mysel in thae weary streets; but you
see I didna come here ance errand to
see the town, but rather came with an
object, mem—and now I’m to bide on
to take care of Johnnie. My mother
down-by at hame has had mony
thochts about him being left his lane,
with naebody but himself to care about
in a strange place—and it’s sure to
be a comfort to her me stopping with
Johnnie, for she kens I’m a weel-meaning
person, whatever folk do to
me; and I would be real thankful if
ye could recommend me to a shop for
good linen, for I have a’ his shirts to
mend. To be sure, he has plenty of
siller—but he’s turning the maist extravagant
lad I ever saw.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good soul! and you have come to
do all those kind things for him,” said
Miss Annie Laurie: “it is so delightful
to me to find these fine homely
natural feelings in operation—so primitive
and unsophisticated. I can’t
tell you what pleasure I have in
watching the natural action of a kind
heart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am much obliged to ye, mem,”
said Nelly, wavering on her seat with
a half intention of rising to acknowledge
with a curtsey this complimentary
declaration. “I was aye kent for a
weel-meaning lass, though I have my
faults—but I’m sure Johnnie ought to
ken how weel he can depend on me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>July Home was standing by the
window—standing very timid and
demure, pretending to look out, but
in reality lost in conjectures concerning
Johnnie Lithgow, whose image
had never left her mind since Miss
Annie took the pains to advise her
not to think of him. July, innocent
heart, would never have thought of
him had this warning been withheld;
but the fascination and thrill of conscious
danger filled July’s mind with
one continual recollection of his presence,
though she did not dare to turn
round frankly and own herself his old
acquaintance. With a slight tremble
in her little figure, July stands by the
window, and July’s silky hair already
begins to droop out of the braid in
which she had confined it with so
much care. A silk gown—the first
and only one of its race belonging to
July—has been put on in honour of
this, her first day at Heathbank; and
July, to tell the truth, is somewhat
fluttered on account of it, and is a
little afraid of herself and the unaccustomed
splendour of her dress.</p>

<p class='c010'>Menie Laurie, a good way apart,
sits on a stool at her mother’s feet,
looking round upon all those faces—from
July’s innocent tremble of shy
pleasure, to Johnnie Lithgow’s wellpleased
recognition of his childish
friend. There is something touching
in the contrast when you turn to
Menie Laurie, looking up, with all
these new-awakened thoughts in her
eyes, into her mother’s face. For
dutiful and loving as Menie has always
been, you can tell by a glance that
she never clung before as she clings
now—that never in her most trustful
childish times was she so humble
in her helplessness as her tender woman’s
love is to-day. Deprecating,
anxious, full of so many wistful beseeching
ways—do you think the
mother does not know why it is that
Menie’s silent devotion thus pleads
and kneels and clings to her very feet?</p>

<p class='c010'>And there is a shadow on Mrs
Laurie’s brow—a certain something
glittering under Mrs Laurie’s eyelid.
No, she needs no interpreter—and the
mother hears Menie’s prayer, “Will
you like him—will you try to like him?”
sounding in her heart, and resolves
that she will indeed try to like him for
Menie’s sake.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr Home, of course, will come to
see us to-night,” said the sprightly
Miss Annie. “My dear Mrs Laurie,
how can I sufficiently thank you for
bringing such a delightful circle of
young people to Heathbank? It quite
renews my heart again. You can’t
think how soon one gets worn out and
weary in this commonplace London
world: but so fresh—so full of young
spirits and life—I assure you, Mr
Lithgow, yourself, and your friend,
and my sweet girls here, are quite like
a spring to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnnie, bowing a response, gradually
drew near the window. You
will begin to think there is something
very simply pretty and graceful in
this little figure standing here within
shadow of the curtain, the evening
sun just missing it as it steals timidly
into the shade. And this brown hair,
so silky soft, has slidden down at last
upon July’s shoulder, and the breath
comes something fast on July’s small
full nether lip, and a little changeful
flush of colour hovers about, coming
and going upon July’s face. Listen—for
now a sweet little timid voice,
fragrant with the low-spoken Border-speech,
softened out of all its harshness,
steals upon Johnnie Lithgow’s
ear. He knows what the words are,
for he draws very near to listen—but
we, a little farther off, hear nothing
but the voice—a very unassured, shy,
girlish voice; and July casts a furtive
look around her, to see if it is not
possible to get Menie Laurie to whisper
her answer to; but when she does
trust the air with these few words of
hers, July feels less afraid.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnnie Lithgow!—no doubt it is
the same Johnnie Lithgow who carried
her through the wood, half a mile
about, to see the sunset from the Resting
Stane—but whether this can be
the Mr Lithgow who is very clever
and a great writer, July is puzzled to
know. For he begins to ask so kindly
about the old homely Kirkland people—he
“minds” every nook and corner
so well, and has such a joyous recollection
of all the Hogmanays and
Hallowe’ens—the boyish pranks and
frolics, the boyish friends. July,
simple and perplexed, thinks within
herself that Randall never did so, and
doubts whether Johnnie Lithgow can
be clever, after all.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p class='c014'>“And July, little girl—you are glad
to see Menie Laurie again?”</p>

<p class='c010'>But July makes a long pause—July
is always timid of speaking to her
brother.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Menie is not Menie now,” said
July thoughtfully. “She never looks
like what she used to look at Burnside.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What has changed her?” At last
Randall began to look interested.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another long pause, and then July
startled him with a burst of tears.
“She never looks like what she used
to look at Burnside,” repeated Menie’s
little friend, with timid sobs, “but
aye thinks, thinks, and has trouble in
her face night and day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The brother and sister were in the
room alone. Randall turned round
with impatience. “What a foolish
little creature you are, July. Menie
does not cry like you for every little
matter; Menie has nothing to trouble
her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s no me, Randall,” said little
July, meekly. “If I cry, I just canna
help it, and it’s nae matter; but, oh,
I wish you would speak to Menie—for
something’s vexing <em>her</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sure you will excuse me for
leaving you so long,” said the sprightly
voice of Miss Annie Laurie, entering
the room. “What! crying, July darling?
Have we not used her well,
Mr Home?—but my poor friend Mrs
Laurie has just got a very unpleasant
letter, and I have been sitting with
her to comfort her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randall made no reply, unless the
smile of indifference which came to his
lips, the careless turning away of his
head, might be supposed to answer;
for Randall did not think it necessary
to pretend any interest in Mrs Laurie.</p>

<p class='c010'>But just then he caught a momentary
glimpse of some one stealing
across the farthest corner of the lawn,
behind a group of shrubs. Randall
could not mistake the figure; and it
seemed to pause there, where it was
completely hidden, except to the keen
eye which had watched it thither, and
still saw a flutter of drapery through
the leaves.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mem, if you please, Miss Menie’s
out,” said Jenny, entering suddenly,
“and the mistress sent me with word
that she wasna very weel hersel, and
would keep up the stair if you’ve nae
objections. As I said, ‘I trow no,
you would have nae objections’—no to
say there’s company in the house to be
a divert—and the mistress is far frae
weel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, Jenny, you must tell my
darling Menie to come in,” said Miss
Annie. “I cannot want her, you
know; and I am sure she cannot
know who is here, or she would never
bid you say she was out. Tell her I
want her, Jenny.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mem, I have told you,” said
Jenny, somewhat fiercely, “if she was
ane given to leasing-making she would
have to get another lass to gang her
errands than Jenny, and I canna tell
whatfor Miss Menie should heed, or
do aught but her ain pleasure, for ony
company that’s here ’enow. I’m no fit
mysel, an auld lass like me, to gang
away after Miss Menie’s licht fit;
but she’s out-by, puir bairn—and it’s
little onybody kens Jenny that would
blame me wi’ a lee.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She had reached the door before
Randall could prevail with himself to
follow her; but at last he did hurry
after Jenny, making a hasty apology
as he went. Randall had by no
means paid to Jenny the respect to
which she held herself entitled: her
quick sense had either heard his step
behind, or surmised that he would
follow her; and Jenny, in a violent
fuff, strongly suppressing herself, but
quivering all over with the effort it
cost her, turned sharp round upon
him, and came to a dead pause facing
him, as he closed the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is Miss Menie Laurie? I
wish to see her,” said Randall. Randall
did not choose to be familiar
even now.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miss Menie Laurie takes her ain
will commonly,” said Jenny, making
a satirical curtsey. “She’s been used
wi’t this lang while; and she hasna
done what Jenny bade her this mony
a weary day. Atweel, if she had,
some things wouldna have been to
undo that are—and mony an hour’s
wark and hour’s peace the haill house
micht ha’e gotten, if she had aye had
the sense to advise with the like of
me; but she’s young, and she takes
her ain gate. Poor thing! she’ll have
to do somebody else’s will soon enough
if there’s nae deliverance; whatfor
should I grudge her her ain the noo?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean? I want to
see Menie,” exclaimed Randall, with
considerable haste and eagerness.
“Do you mean to say she does not
want to see me? I have never been
avoided before. What does she
mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ay, my lad, that’s right,” said
Jenny; “think of yoursel just, like a
man, afore ye gie a kindly thought to
her, and her in trouble. It’s like you
a’; it’s like the haill race and lineage
of ye, father and son. No that I’m
meaning ony ill to auld Crofthill; but
nae doubt he’s a man like the lave.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randall lifted his hand impatiently,
waving her away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wouldna wonder!” cried Jenny.
“I wouldna wonder—no me. She’s
owre mony about that like her, has
she?—it’ll be my turn to gang my
ways, and no trouble the maister. You
would like to get her, now she’s in
her flower; you would like to take
her up and carry her away, and put
her in a cage, like a puir bit singing-burdie,
to be a pleasure to you. What
are you courting my bairn for? It’s
a’ for your ain delight and pleasure,
because ye canna help but be glad at
the sight of her, a darling as she is;
because ye would like to get her to
yoursel, like a piece of land; because
she would be something to you to be
maister and lord of, to make ye the
mair esteemed in ither folks’ een, and
happier for yoursel. Man, I’ve carried
her miles o’ gate in thae very
arms of mine. I’ve watched her grow
year to year, till there’s no ane like
her in a’ the countryside. Is’t for mysel?—she
canna be Jenny’s wife—she
canna be Jenny’s ain born bairn? But
Jenny would put down her neck under
the darling’s foot, if it was to give her
pleasure—and here’s a strange lad
comes that would set away <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Jenny’s vehemence was touched
with such depth of higher feeling as
to exalt it entirely out of the region
of the “fuff.” With a hasty and
trembling hand she dashed away some
tears out of her eyes. “I’m no to
make a fule of mysel afore <em>him</em>,” muttered
Jenny, drawing a hard breath
through her dilated nostrils.</p>

<p class='c010'>Randall, with some passion, and
much scorn in his face, had drawn
back a little to listen. Now he took
up his hat hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you are done, you will let me
pass, perhaps,” he said angrily.
“This is absurd, you know—let me
pass. I warn you I will not quarrel
with Menie for all the old women in
the world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If it’s me, you’re welcome to ca’
me names,” said Jenny, fiercely. “I
daur ye to say a word of the mistress—on
your peril. Miss Menie pleases
to be her lane. I tell you Miss
Menie’s out-by; and I would like to
ken what call ony mortal has to disturb
the poor lassie in her distress,
when she wants to keep it to hersel.
He doesna hear me—he’s gane the
very way she gaed,” said Jenny, softening,
as he burst past her out of sight.
“I’ll no say I think ony waur of him
for that; but waes me, waes me—what’s
to come out o’t a’, but dismay
and distress to my puir bairn?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Distress and dismay—it is not hard
to see them both in Menie Laurie’s
face, so pale and full of thought, as
she leans upon the wall here among
the wet leaves, looking out. Yes, she
is looking out, fixedly and long, but
not upon the misty far-away London,
not upon the pleasant slope of green,
the retired and quiet houses, the whispering
neighbour trees. Something
has brought the dreamy distant future,
the unknown country, bright and far
away—brought it close upon her, laid
it at her feet. Her own living breath
this moment stirs the atmosphere of
this still unaccomplished world; her
foot is stayed upon its threshold. No
more vague fears—no more mere
clouds upon the joyous firmament—but
close before her, dark and tangible,
the crisis and decision—the turning-point
of heart and hope. Before
her wistful eyes lie two clear paths,
winding before her into the evening
sky. Two; but the spectre of a third
comes in upon her—a life distraught
and barren of all comfort—a fate irrevocable,
not to be changed or softened;
and Menie’s heart is deadly sick in
her poor breast, and faints for fear.
Alas for Menie Laurie’s quiet heart!</p>

<p class='c010'>She was sad yesterday. Yesterday
she saw a cloudy sword, suspended in
the skies, wavering and threatening
above her unguarded head; to-day
she looks no longer at this imaginative
menace. From another unfeared
quarter there has fallen a real blow.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p class='c014'>With the heat and flush of excitement
upon his face, Randall Home
made his way across the glistening
lawn, and through the wet shrubs—for
there had been rain—to that corner
of the garden where he had seen
Menie disappear. Impatiently his
foot rung upon the gravel path, and
crushed the fallen branches: something
of an angry glow was in his eye,
and heated and passionate was the
colour on his cheek.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are here, Menie!” he exclaimed.
“I think you might have
had sufficient respect for me, to do
what you could to prevent this last
passage of arms.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Respect!” Menie looked at him
with doubtful apprehension. She
thought the distress of her mind must
have dulled and blunted her nerves;
and repeated the word vacantly,
scarcely knowing what it meant.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I said respect. Is it so presumptuous
an idea?” said Randall, with his
cold sarcastic smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Menie made no answer. Drawing
back with a timid frightened
motion, which did not belong to her
natural character, she stood so very
pale, and chill, and tearful, that you
could have found nowhere a more
complete and emphatic contrast than
she made to her betrothed. The one
so full of strength and vigour, stout
independence and glowing resentment—the
other with all her life gone
out of her, as it seemed, quenched and
subdued in her tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have avoided me in the
house—you will not speak to me now,”
said Randall. “Menie, Menie, what
does this mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>For Menie had not been able to
conceal from him that she was weeping.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is no matter, Randall,” said
Menie; “it is no matter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randall grew more and more excited.
“What is the matter? Have
you ceased to trust me, Menie? What
do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I mean nothing to make you
angry—I never did,” said Menie, sadly.
“I’m not very old yet, but I never
grieved anybody, of my own will, all
my days. Ill never came long ago;
or, if it came, nobody ever blamed it
on me. I wish you would not mind
me,” she said, looking up suddenly.
“I came out here, because my mind
was not fit to speak to anybody—because
I wanted to complain to myself
where nobody should hear of my unthankfulness.
I would not have said
a word to anybody—not a word.
There was no harm in thinking within
my own heart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is harm in hiding your
thoughts from me,” said Randall.
“Come, Menie, you are not to cheat
me of my rights. I was angry—forgive
me; but I am not angry now.
Menie, my poor sorrowful girl, what
ails you? Has something happened?
Menie, you must tell <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is just you I must not tell,”
said Menie, under her breath. Then
she wavered a moment, as if the wind
swayed her light figure, and held her
in hesitating uncertainty; and then,
with a sudden effort, she stood firm,
apart from the wall she had been
leaning on, and apart, too, from Randall’s
extended arm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I will tell you,” said Menie,
seriously. “You mind what happened
a year ago, Randall; you mind
what we did and what we said then—‘For
ever and for ever.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randall took her hand tenderly into
his own, “for ever and for ever.” It
was the words of their troth-plight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will keep it in my heart,” said
poor Menie. “I will never change
in that, but keep it night and day in
my heart. Randall, we are far apart
already. I have a little world you do
not choose to share: you are entering
a greater world, where I can never
have any place. God speed you, and
God go with you, Randall Home.
You will be a great man: you will
prosper and increase; and what would
you do with poor Southland Menie,
who cannot help you in your race?
Randall, we will be good friends: we
will part now, and say farewell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Abrupt as her speech was Menie’s
manner of speaking. She had to hurry
over these disjointed words, lest her
sobs should overtake and choke her
utterance ere they were done.</p>

<p class='c010'>Randall shook his head with displeased
impatience. “This is mere
folly, Menie. What does it mean?
Cannot you tell me simply and frankly
what is the matter, without such a
preface as this? But indeed I know
very well what it means. It means
that I am to yield something—to undertake
something—to reconcile myself
to some necessity or other, distasteful
to me. But why commence
so tragically?—the threat should come
at the end, not at the beginning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I make no threat,” said Menie,
growing colder and colder, more and
more upright and rigid; “I mean to
say nothing that can make you angry.
Already I have been very unhappy.
I dare not venture, with our changed
fortunes, to make a lifelong trial—I
dare not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your changed fortunes!” interrupted
Randall. “Are your fortunes
to-day different from what they were
yesterday?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Menie paused. “It is only a very
poor pride which would conceal it
from you,” she said at length. “Yes,
they are different. Yesterday we had
enough for all we needed—to-day we
have not anything. You will see
how entirely our circumstances are
changed; and I hope you will see too,
Randall, without giving either of us
the pain of mentioning them, all the
reasons which make it prudent for us,
without prolonging the conflict longer,
to say good-by. Good-by; I can ask
nothing of you but to forget me,
Randall.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And Menie held out her hand, but
could not lift her eyes. Her voice
had sunk very low, and a slight shiver
of extreme self-constraint passed over
her—her head drooped lower and
lower on her breast—her fingers
played vacantly with the glistening
leaves; and when he did not take it,
her hand gradually dropped and fell
by her side.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a moment’s silence—no
answer—no response—no remonstrance.
Perhaps, after all, the poor
perverse heart had hoped to be overwhelmed
with love which would take
no denial: as it was, standing before
him motionless, a great faintness came
upon Menie. She could vaguely see
the path at her feet, the trees on either
hand. “I had better go, then,” she
said, very low and softly; and the
light had faded suddenly upon Menie’s
sight into a strange ringing twilight,
full of floating motes and darkness—and
those few paces across the lawn
filled all her mind like a life journey,
so full of difficulty they seemed, so
weak was she.</p>

<p class='c010'>Go quickly, Menie—quickly, ere
those growing shadows darken into a
blind unguided night—swiftly, ere
these faltering feet grow powerless,
and refuse to obey the imperative
eager will. To reach home—to reach
home—home, such a one as it is, lies
only half a dozen steps away; press
forward, Menie—are those years or
hours that pass in the journey? But
the hiding-place and shelter is almost
gained.</p>

<p class='c010'>When suddenly this hand which he
would not take is grasped in his vigorous
hold—suddenly this violent tremble
makes Menie feel how he supports
her, and how she leans on him. “I
am going home,” said Menie, faintly.
Still he made no answer, but held her
strongly, wilfully; not resisting, but
unaware of her efforts to escape.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have wherewith to work for you,
Menie,” said the man’s voice in her
ear. “What are your changed fortunes
to me? If you were a princess,
I would receive you less joyfully, for
you would have less need of me.
Menie, Menie, why have you tried
yourself so sorely—and why should
this be a cause of separating us? I
wanted only you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And Menie’s pride had failed her.
She hid her face in her hands, and
cried, “My mother, my mother!” in
a passion of tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your mother, your mother? But
you have a duty to me,” said Randall,
more coldly. “Your mother must
not bid you give me up: you have no
right to obey. Ah! I see; I am dull
and stupid; forgive me, Menie. You
mean that your mother’s fortunes are
changed. She has the more need of
a son then; and my May Marion
knows well, that to be her mother is
enough for me—you understand me,
Menie. This does not change our
attachment, does not change our plans,
our prospects in the slightest degree.
It may make it more imperative that
your mother should live with us, but
<em>you</em> will think that no misfortune.
Well, are we to have no more heroics
now—nothing tragical—but only a
little good sense and patience on all
sides, and my Menie what she always
is? Come, look up and tell
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I meant nothing heroic—nothing.
What I said was not false, Randall,”
said Menie, looking up with some fire.
“If you think it was unreal, that I
did not mean it—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you do not mean it now, is not
that enough?” said Randall, smiling.
“Let us talk of something less
weighty. July says you do not look
as you used to do; has this been
weighing on your mind, Menie? But,
indeed, you have not told me what
the misfortune is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We knew it only to-day,” said
Menie. Menie spoke very low, and
was very much saddened and humbled,
quite unable to make any defence
against Randall’s lordly manner of
setting her emotion aside. “My father’s
successors were young men, and
the price they paid for entering on his
practice was my mother’s annuity.
But now they are both gone; one
died two years ago, the other only
last week—and he has died very poor,
and in debt, the lawyer writes; so
that there is neither hope nor chance
of having anything from those he
leaves behind. So we have no longer
an income; nothing now but my mother’s
liferent in Burnside.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Menie Laurie did not know what
poverty was. It was not any apprehension
of this which drew from her
eyes those few large tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, that will be enough for
your mother,” said Randall. It was
impossible for Menie to say a word or
make an objection, so completely had
he put her aside, and taken it for
granted that his will should decide
all. “Or if it was not enough, what
then? Provision for the future lies
with me—and you need not fear for
me, Menie. I am not quarrelsome.
You need not look so deprecating and
frightened: you will find no disappointment
in me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Was Menie reassured? It was not
easy to tell; for very new to Menie
Laurie was this trembling humility of
tone and look—this faltering and wavering—as
if she knew not to which
side to turn. But Randall began to
speak, as he knew how, of her own
self, and of their betrothing, “for ever
and for ever;” and the time these
words were said came back upon her
with new power. Her mind was not
satisfied, her heart was not convinced,
and very trembling and insecure now
was her secret response to Randall’s
declaration that she should find no
disappointment in him; but her heart
was young, and all unwilling to give
up its blithe existence. Instinctively
she fled from her own pain, and accepted
the returning hope and pleasantness.
Bright pictures rose before
Menie, of a future household harmonious
and full of peace—of the new
love growing greater, fuller, day by
day—the old love sacred and strong,
as when it stood alone. Why did she
fear? why did a lurking terror in her
heart cry No, no! with a sob and
pang? After all, this was no vain
impracticable hope; many a one had
realised it—it was right and true for
ever under the skies; and Menie put
her hand upon the arm of her betrothed,
and closed her eyes for a
moment with a softening sense of relief
and comfort, and gentle tears
under the lids. Let him lead forward;
who can tell the precious stores of
love, and tenderness, and supreme regard
that wait him as his guerdon?
Let him lead forward—on to those
bright visionary days—in to this
peaceful home.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Perhaps next to the pleasure of doing
all for those we love best, the joy
of receiving all ranks highest. With
her heart elate, Menie went in again
to the house she had left so sadly—went
in again, looking up to Randall,
rejoicing in the thought that from him
every daily gift—all that lay in the
future—should henceforth come. And
if it were well to be Menie’s mother—chief
over one child’s heart which
could but love—how much greater joy
to be Randall’s mother, high in the
reverent thought of such a mind as
his! Now there remained but one
difficulty—to bring the mother and
the son lovingly together—to let no
misconception, no false understanding
blind the one’s sight of the other—to
clear away all evil judgment of
the past—to show each how worthy
of esteem and high appreciation the
other was. She thought so in her own
simple soul, poor heart! Through her
own great affection she looked at both—to
either of them <em>she</em> would have
yielded without a murmur her own
little prides and resentments; and the
light of her eyes suffused them with a
circle of mingling radiance; and sweet
was the fellowship and kindness, pure
the love and good offices, harmonious
and noble the life of home and every
day, which blossomed out of Menie
Laurie’s heart and fancy, in the reaction
of her hopeless grief.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs Laurie sits very thoughtful and
still by the window. Menie’s mother,
in her undisturbed and quiet life, had
never found out before how proud she
was. Now she feels it in her nervous
shrinking from speech of her misfortune—in
the involuntary haughtiness
with which she starts and recoils from
sympathy. Without a word of comment
or lamentation, the mere bare
facts, and nothing more, she has communicated
to Miss Annie; and Mrs
Laurie had much difficulty in restraining
outward evidence of the burst of
indignant impatience with which, in
her heart, she received Miss Annie’s
effusive pity and real kindness. Miss
Annie, thinking it best not to trouble
her kinswoman in the present mood
of her mind, has very discreetly carried
her pity to some one who will receive
it better, and waits till “poor
dear Mrs Laurie” shall recover her
composure; while even July, repelled
by the absorbed look, and indeed by
an abrupt short answer, too, withdraws,
and hangs about the other end
of the room, like a little shadow, ever
and anon gliding across the window
with her noiseless step, and her stream
of falling hair.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs Laurie’s face is full of thought—what
is she to do? But, harder far
than that, what is Menie to do?—Menie,
who vows never to leave her—who
will not permit her to meet the
chill fellowship of poverty alone. A
little earthen-floored Dumfriesshire
cottage, with its kailyard and its one
apartment, is not a very pleasant
anticipation to Mrs Laurie herself,
who has lived the most part of her
life, and had her share of the gifts of
fortune; but what will it be to Menie,
whose life has to be made yet, and
whose noontide and prime must all be
influenced by such a cloud upon her
dawning day? The mother’s brow is
knitted with heavy thought—the
mother’s heart is pondering with
strong anxiety. Herself must suffer
largely from this change of fortune,
but she cannot see herself for Menie—Menie:
what is Menie to do?</p>

<p class='c010'>Will it be better to see her married
to Randall Home, and then to go
away solitary to the cothouse in Kirklands,
to spend out this weary life—these
lingering days? But Mrs Laurie’s
heart swells at the thought. Perhaps
it will be best; perhaps it is what we
must make up our mind to, and even
urge upon her; but alas and alas! how
heavily the words, the very thought,
rings in to Mrs Laurie’s heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now here they are coming,
their youth upon them like a mantle
and a crown—coming, but not with
downcast looks; not despondent, nor
afraid, nor touched at all with the
heaviness which bows down the mother’s
spirit to the very dust. Menie
will go, then. Close your eyes, mother,
from the light; try to think you are
glad; try to rejoice that she will be
content to part from you. It is “for
her good”—is there anything
you would not do “for her good,”
mother? It has come to the decision
now; and look how she comes with
her hand upon his arm, her eyes turning
to his, her heart elate. She will
be his wife, then—his Menie first, and
not her mother’s; but have we not
schooled our mind to be content?</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, she is coming, poor heart!
coming with her new hope glorious
in her eyes; coming to bring the
son to his mother; coming herself
with such a great embracing love as
is indeed enough of its own might
and strength to unite them for ever;
and Menie thinks that now she cannot
fail.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now they are seated all of them
about the window, July venturing
forward to join the party; and as nothing
better can be done, there commences
an indifferent conversation,
as far removed as possible from the
real subject of their thoughts. There
sits Mrs Laurie, sick with her heavy
musings, believing that she now stands
alone, that her dearest child has made
up her mind to forsake her, and that
in solitude and meagre poverty she
will have to wait for slow-coming
age and death. Here is Randall,
looking for once out of himself, with
a real <em>will</em> and anxiety to soften, by
every means in his power, the misfortunes
of Menie’s mother, and rousing
himself withal to the joy of carrying
Menie home—to the sterner necessity
of doing a man’s work to provide for
her, and for the new household; and
all the wonder you can summon—no
small portion in those days—flutters
about the same subject, little
July Home; and you think in your
heart if you but could, what marvellous
things you <em>would</em> do for Menie
Laurie, and Menie Laurie’s mother;
while Menie herself, with a wistful
new-grown habit of observation, reads
everybody’s face, and knows not
whether to be most afraid of the obstinate
gloom upon her mother’s brow,
or exultant in the delicate attention,
the sudden respectfulness and regard,
of Randall’s bearing. But this little
company, all so earnestly engrossed—all
surrounding a matter of the
vitallest importance to each—turn
aside to talk of Miss Annie Laurie’s
toys—Miss Annie Laurie’s party—and
only when they divide and separate
dare speak of what lies at their heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>And Mrs Laurie is something hard
to be conciliated. Mrs Laurie is much
inclined to resent this softening of
manner as half an insult to her change
of fortune. Patience, Menie! though
your mother rebuffs him, he bears it
nobly. The cloud will not lighten
upon her brow—cannot lighten—for
you do not know how heavily this
wistful look of yours, this very anxiety
to please her—and all your transparent
wiles and artifices—your suppressed
and trembling hope, strikes
upon your mother’s heart. “She will
go away—she will leave me.” Your
mother says so, Menie, within herself;
and it is so hard, so very hard, to persuade
the unwilling content with that
sad argument, “It is for her good.”
Now, draw your breath softly lest she
hear how your heart beats, for Randall
has asked her to go to the garden
with him, to speak of this; and Mrs
Laurie rises with a sort of desolate
stateliness—rises—accepts his offered
arm, and turns away—poor Menie!
with an averted face, and without a
glance at you.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now there follows a heavy time—a
little space of curious restless suspense.
Wandering from window to
window, from table to table; striking
a few notes on the ever-open piano;
opening a book now, taking up a piece
of work then, Menie strays about, in
an excitement of anxiety which she
can neither suppress nor conceal.
Will they be friends? such friends—such
loving friends as they might be,
being as they are in Menie’s regard
so noble and generous both? Will
they join heartily and cordially? will
they clasp hands upon a kindly bargain?
But Menie shrinks, and closes
her eyes—she dares not look upon the
alternative.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Menie, will you not sit down?”
Little July Home follows Menie with
her eyes almost as wistfully as Menie
follows Randall and her mother.
There is no answer, for Menie is so
fully occupied that the little timid
voice fails to break through the trance
of intense abstraction in which her
heart is separated from this present
scene. “Menie!” Speak louder,
little girl: Menie cannot hear you, for
other voices speaking in her heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>So July steals across the room with
her noiseless step, and has her arm
twined through Menie’s before she is
aware. “Come and sit down—what
are they speaking about, Menie? Do
you no hear me? Oh, Menie, is it
our Randall?—is it his blame?”</p>

<p class='c010'>July is so near crying that she must
be answered. “Nobody is to blame;
there is no harm,” said Menie, quickly,
leading her back to her seat—quickly
with an imperative hush and haste,
which throws July back into timid
silence, and sets all her faculties astir
to listen, too. But there comes no
sound into this quiet room—not even
the footsteps which have passed out
of hearing upon the garden path, nor
so much as an echo of the voices which
Menie knows to be engaged in converse
which must decide her fate.
But this restless and visible solicitude
will not do; it is best to take up her
work resolutely, and sit down with
her intent face turned towards the
window, from which at least the first
glance of them may be seen as they
return.</p>

<p class='c010'>No,—no need to start and blush
and tremble; this step, ringing light
upon the path, is not the stately step
of Randall—not our mother’s sober
tread. “It’s no them, Menie—it’s
just Miss Laurie,” whispers little
startled July from the corner of the
window. So long away—so long
away—and Menie cannot tell whether
it is a good or evil omen—but still
they do not come.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My sweet children, are you here
alone?” said Miss Annie, setting
down her little basket. “Menie, love,
I have just surprised your mamma
and Mr Randall, looking very wise, I
assure you; you ought to be quite
thankful that you are too young
to share such deliberations. July,
dear, you must come and have your
lesson; but I cannot teach you to play
that favourite tune; oh no, it would be
quite improper—though he has very
good taste, has he not, darling?
But somebody will say I have designs
upon Mr Lithgow, if I always play
his favourite tune.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So saying, Miss Annie sat down
before the piano, and began to sing,
“For bonnie Annie Laurie I’ll lay
down my head and dee.” Poor Johnnie
Lithgow had no idea, when he
praised the pretty little graceful melody
and delicate verses, that he was
paying a compliment to the lady of
Heathbank.</p>

<p class='c010'>And July, with a blush, and a
little timid eagerness, stole away to
Miss Annie’s side. July had never
before touched any instrument except
Menie Laurie’s old piano at Burnside,
and with a good deal of awe had
submitted to Miss Annie’s lessons.
It did seem a very delightful prospect
to be able to play this favourite tune,
though July would have thought very
little of it, but for Miss Annie’s constant
warnings. Thanks to these,
however, and thanks to his own kindly
half-shy regards, Johnnie Lithgow’s
favourite tunes, favourite books, favourite
things and places, began to
grow of great interest to little July
Home. She thought it was very
foolish to remember them all, and
blushed in secret when Johnnie Lithgow’s
name came into her mind as an
authority; but nevertheless, in spite
of shame and blushing, a great authority
Johnnie Lithgow had grown,
and July stood by the piano, eager
and afraid, longing very much to be
as accomplished as Miss Annie, to be
able to play his favourite tune.</p>

<p class='c010'>While Menie Laurie still sits by
the window, intent and silent, hearing
nothing of song or music, but
only aware of a hum of inarticulate
voices, which her heart longs and
strains to understand, but cannot
hear.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The music is over, the lesson concluded,
and July sits timidly before
the piano, striking faint notes with
one finger, and marvelling greatly how
it is possible to extract anything like
an intelligible strain from this waste
of unknown chords. Miss Annie is
about in the room once more, giving
dainty touches to its somewhat defective
arrangement—throwing down a
book here, and there altering an ornament.
Patience, Menie Laurie! many
another one before you has sat in
resolute outward calm, with a heart
all a-throb and trembling, even as
yours is. Patience; though it is hard
to bear the rustling of Miss Annie’s
dress—the faint discords of July’s
music. It must have been one time
or another, this most momentous interview—all
will be over when it is over.
Patience, we must wait.</p>

<p class='c010'>But it is a strange piece of provocation
on Miss Annie’s part, that she
should choose this time and no other
for looking over that little heap of
Menie’s drawings upon the table.
Menie is not ambitious as an artist—few
ideas or romances are in these
little works of hers; they are only
some faces—not very well executed—the
faces of those two or three people
whom Menie calls her own.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come and show them to me, my
love.” Menie must not disobey, though
her first impulse is to spring out of the
low opened window, and rush away
somewhere out of reach of all interruption
till this long suspense is done.
But Menie does not rush away; she
only rises slowly—comes to Miss
Annie’s side—feels the pressure of
Miss Annie’s embracing arm round
her—and turns over the drawings;
strangely aware of every line in them,
yet all the while in a maze of abstraction,
listening for their return.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here is Menie’s mother—and here
again another, and yet another, sketch
of her; and this is Randall Home.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know, I think they are very
like,” said Miss Annie: “you must
do my portrait, Menie, darling—you
must indeed. I shall take no denial;
you shall do me in my white muslin,
among my flowers; and we will put
Mr Home’s sweet book on the table,
and open it at that scene—that scene,
you know, I pointed out to you the
other day. I know what inspired him
when he wrote that. Come, my love,
it will divert you from thinking of this
trouble—your mamma should not
have told you—shall we begin now?
But Menie, dear, don’t you think you
have put a strange look in this face
of Mr Randall? It is like him—but I
would not choose you to do me with
such an expression as that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Half wild with her suspense, Menie
by this time scarcely heard the words
that rang into her ears, scarcely saw
the face she looked upon; but suddenly,
as Miss Annie spoke, a new light
seemed to burst upon this picture, and
there before her, looking into her eyes,
with the smile of cold supervision
which she always feared to see, with
the incipient curl of contempt upon
his lip—the pride of self-estimation
in his eye—was Randall’s face, glowing
with contradiction to all her sudden
hopes. Her own work, and she
has never had any will to look at him
in this aspect; but the little picture
blazes out upon her like a sudden enlightenment.
Here is another one,
done by the loving hand of memory a
year ago; but, alas! there is no enchantment
to bring back this ideal
glory, this glow of genial love and
life that makes it bright—a face of the
imagination, taking all its wealth
of expression from the heart which
suffused these well-remembered features
with a radiance of its own;
but the reality looks out on Menie
darkly; the face of a man not to be
moved by womanish influences—not to
be changed by a burst of strong emotion—not
to be softened, mellowed,
won, by any tenderness—a heart that
can love, indeed, but never can forget
itself; a mind sufficient for its own
rule, a soul which knows no generous
<em>abandon</em>, which holds its own will and
manner firm and strong above all
other earthly things. This is the face
which looks on Menie Laurie out of
her own picture, startling her heart,
half distraught with fond hopes and
dreams into the chill daylight again—full
awake.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will make portraits,” said Menie,
hastily, in a flood of sudden bitterness,
“when we go away, when we
go home—I can do it—this shall be
my trade.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And Menie closed the little portfolio
abruptly, and went back to her
seat without another word; went
back with the blood tingling through
her veins, with all her pride and all
her strength astir; with a vague impetuous
excitement about her—an impulse
of defiance. So long—so long:
what keeps them abroad lingering
among these glistening trees?—perhaps
because they are afraid to tell her
that her fate is sealed; and, starting
to her feet, the thought is strong on
Menie to go forth and meet them, to
bid them have no fear for her, to tell
them her delusion is gone for ever,
and that there is no more light remaining
under the skies.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hush! there are footsteps on the
path. Who are these that come together,
leaning, the elder on the
younger, the mother on the son!
With such a grace this lofty head
stoops to our mother; with such a
kindly glance she lifts her eyes to him;
and they are busy still with the consultation
which has occupied so long
a time. While she stands arrested,
looking at them as they draw near—growing
aware of their full amity and
union—a shiver of great emotion
comes upon Menie—then, or ever she
is conscious, a burst of tears. In another
moment all her sudden enlightenment
is gone, quenched out of
her eyes, out of her heart—and Menie
puts the tears away with a faltering
hand, and stands still to meet them in
a quiet tremor of joy, the same loving
Menie as of old.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>My</em> bairn!” Mrs Laurie says nothing
more as she draws her daughter
close to her, and puts her lips softly
to Menie’s brow. It is the seal of the
new bond. The mother and the son
have been brought together; the past
is gone for ever like a dream of the
night; and into the blessed daylight,
full of the peaceful rays God sends us
out of heaven, we open our eyes as to
another life. Peace and sweet harmony
to Menie Laurie’s heart!</p>

<p class='c010'>Put away the picture; lay it by
where no one again shall believe its
slander true; put away this false-reporting
face; put away the strange
clear-sightedness which came upon us
like a curse. No need to inquire how
much was false—it is past, and we
begin anew.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, Menie, I am quite satisfied.”
It is Mrs Laurie herself who volunteers
this declaration, while Menie, on the
little stool at her feet, looks up wistfully,
eager to hear, but not venturing
to ask what her conversation with
Randall was. “We said a great
many things, my dear—a great deal
about you, Menie, and something
about our circumstances too. The
rent of Burnside will be a sufficient
income for me. I took it kind of
Randall to say so, for it shows that
he knew I would not be dependent;
and as for you, Menie, I fancy you
will be very well and comfortable,
according to what he says. So you
will have to prepare, my dear—to
prepare for your new life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Menie hid her face in her mother’s
lap. Prepare—not the bridal garments,
the household supplies—something
more momentous, and of greater
delicacy—the mind and the heart;
and if this must always be something
solemn and important, whatever
the circumstances, how much more
so to Menie, whose path had been
crossed already by such a spectre?
She sat there, her eyes covered
with her hands, her head bowing
down upon her mother’s knee; but
the heavy doubt had flown from her,
leaving nothing but lighter cloudy
shadows—maidenly fears and tremblings—in
her way. Few hearts were
more honest than Menie’s, few more
wistfully desirous of doing well; and
now it is with no serious anticipations
of evil, but only with the natural
thrill and tremor, the natural excitement
of so great an epoch drawing
close at hand, that Menie’s fingers
close with a startled pressure on her
mother’s hand, as she is bidden prepare.</p>

<p class='c010'>What is this that has befallen little
July Home? There never were such
throngs of unaccountable blushes,
such a suffusion of simple surprise.
Something is on her lips perpetually,
which she does not venture to speak—some
rare piece of intelligence,
which July cannot but marvel at herself
in silent wonder, and which she
trembles to think Menie and “a’body
else” will marvel at still more. Withdrawing
silently into dark corners,
sitting there doing nothing, in long fits
of reverie, quite unusual with July;
coming forward so conscious and
guilty, when called upon; and now,
at this earliest opportunity, throwing
her arms round Menie Laurie’s neck,
and hiding her little flushed and agitated
face upon Menie’s shoulder.
What has befallen July Home?</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think it’s a’ true, Menie?
He wouldna say what he didna mean;
but I think it’s for our Randall’s sake—it
canna be for me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>For July has not the faintest idea,
as she lets this soft silken hair of hers
fall down on her cheek without an
effort to restrain it, that Johnnie
Lithgow would not barter one smile
upon that trembling child’s lip of hers
for all the Randalls in the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He says he’ll go to the Hill, and
tell them a’ at hame,” said July.
“Eh, Menie, what will they say? And
he’s to tell Randall first of all. I
wish I was away, no to see Randall,
Menie; he’ll just laugh, and think it’s
no true—for I see mysel it canna be
for me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is for you, July; you must
not think anything else; there is nobody
in the world like you to Johnnie
Lithgow.” And slowly July’s head
is raised—a bright shy look of wonder
gradually growing into conviction, a
sudden waking of higher thought and
deeper feeling in the open simple face;
a sudden flush of crimson—the woman’s
blush—and July withdrew herself
from her friend’s embrace, and
stole a little apart into the shadow,
and wept a few tears. Was it true?
For her, and not for another! But
it is a long time before this grand
discovery can look a truth and real,
to July’s humble eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>But, nevertheless, it is very true.
Randall’s little sister, Menie’s child-friend,
the little July of Crofthill, has
suddenly been startled into womanhood
by this unexpected voice. After
a severer fashion than has ever confined
it before, July hastily fastens
up her silky hair, hastily wipes off all
traces of the tears upon her cheek,
and is composed and calm, after a
sweet shy manner of composure, lifting
up her little gentle head with a
newborn pride, eager to bring no
discredit on her wooer’s choice. And
already July objects to be laughed at,
and feels a slight offence when she is
treated as a child—not for herself, but
for him, whom now she does not quite
care to have called <em>Johnnie</em> Lithgow,
but is covetous of respect and honour
for, as she never was for Randall,
though secretly in her own heart
July still doubts of his genius, and
cannot choose but think Randall must
be <em>cleverer</em> than his less assuming
friend.</p>

<p class='c010'>And in this singular little company,
where all these feelings are astir, it is
hardly possible to preserve equanimity
of manners. Miss Annie herself, the
lady of the house, sits at her little
work-table, in great delight, running
over now and then in little outbursts
of enthusiasm, discoursing of Mr
Home’s sweet book, of Mr Lithgow’s
charming articles, and occasionally
making a demonstration of joy and
sympathy in the happiness of her
darling girls, which throws Menie—Menie,
always conscious of Randall’s
eye upon her, the eye of a lover, it is
true, but something critical withal—into
grave and painful embarrassment,
and covers July’s stooping face with
blushes. Mrs Laurie, busy with her
work, does what she can to keep the
conversation “sensible,” but with no
great success. The younger portion
of the company are too completely
occupied, all of them, to think of ordinary
intercourse. Miss Annie’s room
was never so bright, never so rich
with youthful hopes and interests
before. Look at them, so full of individual
character, unconscious as
they are of any observation—though
Nelly Panton, very grim in the stiff
coat armour of her new assumed gentility,
sits at the table sternly upright,
watching them all askance, with
vigilant unloving eye.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lithgow, good fellow, sits by Miss
Annie. Though he laughs now and
then, he still does not scorn the natural
goodness, the natural tenderness
of heart, which make their appearance
under these habitual affectations—the
juvenile tricks and levities of her
unreverent age. Poor Miss Annie
Laurie has been content to resign the
reverence, in a vain attempt at equality;
but Lithgow, who is no critic
by nature, remembers gratefully her
true kindness, and smiles only as
little as possible at the fictitious
youthfulness which Miss Annie herself
has come to believe in. So he
sits and bears with her, her little
follies and weaknesses, and, in his
unconscious humility, is magnanimous,
and does honour to his manhood.
Within reach of his kindly eye, July
bends her head over her work, glancing
up now and then furtively to see
who is looking at him—to see, in the
second place, who is noticing or
laughing at her; and July, with all
her innocent heart, is grateful to Miss
Annie. So many kind things she
says—and in July’s guileless apprehension
they are all so true.</p>

<p class='c010'>Graver, but not less happy, Menie
Laurie pursues her occupation by
July’s side, rarely looking up at all,
pondering in her own heart the many
weighty things that are to come,
with her tremor of fear, her joy of
deliverance scarcely yet quieted, and
all her heart and all her mind engaged—in
dreams no longer, but in sober
thought; sober thought—thoughts of
great devotion, of lifelong love and
service, of something nobler than the
common life. Very serious are these
ponderings, coming down to common
labours, the course of every day; and
Menie does not know the nature of
her dreamings—they look to her so
real, so sober, and so true—and would
scorn your warning, if you told her
that not the wildest story of Arabian
genii was more romance than those,
her sober plans and thoughts.</p>

<p class='c010'>Apart, and watching all, stands
Randall Home. There is love in his
eye—you cannot doubt it—love, and
the impulse of protection, the strong
appropriating grasp. There is something
more. Look how his head rises
in the dimmer background above the
table and the lights, above the little
company assembled there. With
something like laughter, his eye turns
upon July—upon July’s wooer, his
own friend—kindly, yet with a sense
of superiority, an involuntary elevation
of himself above them both. And
this glance upon Miss Annie is mere
scorn, nothing higher; and his eye
has scarcely had time to recover itself,
when its look falls, bright and
softened, upon his betrothed; a look of
love—question it not, simple Menie—but
it is calm, superior, above you still.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<p class='c014'>“They tell me it’s a haill month
since it was a’ settled, but I hear
naething of the house or the plenishing,
and no a word of what Jenny’s
to do. If they’re no wanting me, I’m
no wanting them—ne’er a bit. It’s
aye the way guid service is rewarded;
and whatfor should there be ony
odds with Jenny? I might have kent
that muckle, if I had regarded counsel,
or thought of my ainsel; but aye
Jenny’s foremost thought was of
them, for a’ such an ill body as she
is now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And a tear was in Jenny’s eye, as
she smoothed down the folds of
Menie’s dress—Menie’s finest dress,
her own present, which Menie was to
wear to-night. And Menie’s ornaments
are all laid out carefully upon
the table, everything she is likely to
need, before Jenny’s lingering step
leaves the room. “I canna weel tell,
for my pairt, what like life’ll be without
her,” muttered Jenny, as she
went away. “I reckon no very
muckle worth the minding about;
but I’m no gaun to burden onybody
that doesna want me—no, if I should
never hae anither hour’s comfort a’
my days.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And slowly, with many a backward
glance and pause, Jenny withdrew.
Neglect is always hard to bear.
Jenny believed herself to be left out
of their calculations—forgotten of
those to whom she had devoted so
many years of her life; and Jenny,
though she tried to be angry, could
not manage it, but felt her indignant
eyes startled with strange tears. It
made a singular cloud upon her face
this unusual emotion; the native
impatience only struggled through it
fitfully in angry glimpses, though
Jenny was furious at herself for feeling
so desolate, and very fain would
have thrown off her discomfort in a
fuff—but far past the region of the
fuff was this her new-come solitude
of heart. Her friends were dead
or scattered, her life was all bound
up in her mistress and her mistress’s
child, and it was no small trial for
Jenny to find herself thus cast off
and thrown aside.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next who enters this room has
a little heat about her, a certain atmosphere
of annoyance and displeasure.
“I will be a burden”—unawares
the same words steal over Mrs Laurie’s
lip, but the sound of her voice checks
her. Two or three steps back and
forward through the room, a long
pause before the window, and then
her brow is cleared. You can see
the shadows gradually melting away,
as clouds melt from the sky, and in
another moment she has left the room,
to resume her place down stairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>This vacant room—nothing can you
learn from its calm good order, its
windows open to the sun, its undisturbed
and home-like quiet, of what
passes within its walls. There is
Menie’s little Bible on the table; it
is here where Menie brings her doubts
and troubles, to resolve them, if they
may be resolved. But there is no
whisper here to tell you what happens
to Menie, when, as has already
chanced, some trouble comes upon
her which it is not easy to put away.
Hush! This time the door opens
slowly, gravely—this time it is a footstep
very sober, something languid,
which comes in; and Menie Laurie
puts up her hand to her forehead, as
if a pain was there; but not a word
says Menie Laurie’s reverie—not a
word. If she is sad, or if she is
merry, there is no way to know. She
goes about her toilette like a piece of
business, and gives no sign.</p>

<p class='c010'>But this month has passed almost
like age upon Menie Laurie’s face.
You can see that grave thoughts are
common now, everyday guests and
friends in her sobered life, and that
she has begun to part with her
romances of joy and noble life—has
begun to realise more truly what
manner of future it is which lies before
her. Nothing evil, perhaps—little
hardship in it; no great share of
labour, of poverty, or care—but no
longer the grand ideal life, the dream
of youthful souls.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now she stands before the
window, wearing Jenny’s gown. It
is only to look out if any one is
visible upon the road—but there is no
passenger yet approaching Heathbank,
and Menie goes calmly down
stairs. As it happens, the drawing-room
is quite vacant of all but Nelly
Panton, who sits prim by the wall in
one corner. Nelly is not an invited
guest, but has come as a volunteer, in
right of her brother’s invitation, and
Miss Annie shows her sense of the
intrusion by leaving her alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Na, I’m no gaun to bide very
lang in London,” said Nelly. “Ye
see, Miss Menie, you’re an auld
friend. I’m no so blate, but I may
tell you. I didna come up here ance
errand for my ain pleasure, but
mostly to see Johnnie, and to try if I
couldna get ony word of a very decent
lad, ane Peter Drumlie, that
belangs about our countryside. We
were great friends, him and me, and
then we had an outcast—you’ll ken
by yoursel—but we’ve made it up
again since I came to London, and
I’m gaun hame to get my providing,
and comfort my mother a wee while,
afore I leave her athegither. It’s a
real duty comforting folk’s mother,
Miss Menie. I’m sure I wouldna
forget that for a’ the lads in the
world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And where are you to live, Nelly?”
Nelly’s moralising scarcely called for
an answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We havena just made up our
minds; they say ae marriage aye
makes mair,” said Nelly, with a grim
smile. “Miss Menie, you’ve set us
a’ agaun.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps Menie did not care to be
classed with Nelly Panton. “July
Home will be a very young wife,”
she said; “I think your brother
should be very happy with her,
Nelly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wouldna wonder,” said Nelly,
shortly; “but you see, Miss Menie,
our Johnnie’s a well-doing lad, and
micht ha’e looked higher, meaning
nae offence to you; though nae doubt
it’s true what Randall Home said
when he was speaking about this.
‘Lithgow,’ says he (for he ca’s Johnnie
by his last name—it’s a kind o’ fashion
hereaway), ‘if you get naething with
your wife, I will take care to see
you’re no cumbered with onybody
but hersel;’ which nae doubt is a
great comfort, seeing there micht
ha’e been a haill troop of friends,
now that Johnnie’s getting up in the
world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What was that Randall Home
said?” Menie asked the question in a
very clear distinct tone, cold and
steady and unfaltering—“What do
you say he said?—tell me again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He said, Johnnie wouldna be
troubled with nane of her friends,” said
Nelly; “though he has her to keep,
a bit wee silly thing, that can do
naething in a house—and nae doubt
a maid to keep to her forby—that he
wouldna have ony of her friends a
burden on him; and a very wise thing
to say, and a great comfort. I aye
said he was a sensible lad, Randall
Home. Eh, preserve me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>For Randall Home stands before
her, his eyes glowing on her with
haughty rage. He has heard it, every
single deliberate word, and Randall
is no coward—he comes in person to
answer for what he has said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Rise, Menie Laurie! Slowly they
gather over us, these kind shadows of
the coming night; no one can see the
momentary faltering which inclines
you to throw yourself down there
upon the very ground, and weep your
heart out. Rise; it is you who are
stately now.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is true?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She is so sure of it, that there needs
no other form of question, and Menie
lays her hand upon the table to support
herself, and stands firmly before
him waiting for his answer. Why is
it that now, at this moment, when
she should be most strong, the passing
wind brings to her, as in mockery,
an echo of whispering mingled voices—the
timid happiness of July Home?
But Menie draws up her light figure,
draws herself apart from the touch of
her companions, and stands, as she
fancies she must do henceforth, all
her life, alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is true?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I would disdain myself if I tried to
escape by any subterfuge,” said Randall,
proudly; “I might answer that
I never said the words this woman
attributes to me; but that I do
not need to tell you. I would not
deceive you, Menie. I never can deny
what I have given expression to; and
you are right—it is true.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And Randall thinks he hears a
voice, wavering somewhere, far off,
and distant like an echo—not coming
from these pale lips which move and
form the words, but falling out upon
the air—faint, yet distinct, not to be
mistaken. “I am glad you have told
me. I thank you for making no difficulty
about it: this is very well.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Menie! you are not moved by this
gossip’s story? This that I said has no
effect on you? Menie! Is a woman
like this to make a breach between
you and me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>In stolid malice, Nelly Panton sits
still, and listens with a certain melancholy
enjoyment of the mischief she
has made, protesting, under her
breath, that “she meant nae ill; she
aye did a’thing for the best;” while
Randall, forgetful of his own acknowledgment,
repeats again and again
his indignant remonstrance, “a woman
like this!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, she has no such power,” said
Menie firmly—“no such power. Pardon
me—I am wanted to-night. My
strength is not my own to be wasted
now; we can conclude this matter
another time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Before he could say a word, the
door had closed upon her. There
was a bustle without, a glimmer of
coming lights upon the wall. In a
few minutes the room was lighted up,
the lady of the house in her presiding
place—and Randall started with
angry pride from the place where he
stood, by the side of Nelly Panton,
whose gloomy unrelieved figure suddenly
stood out in bold relief upon
the brightened wall.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another time! Menie Laurie has
not gone to ponder upon what this
other conference shall be—she is not
by her own window—she is not out
of doors—she has gone to no such refuge.
Where she never went before,
into the heart of Miss Annie’s preparations—into
the bustle of Miss
Annie’s hospitality—shunning even
Jenny, far more shunning her mother,
and waiting only till the room is full
enough, to give her a chance of escaping
every familiar eye. This is the
first device of Menie’s mazed, bewildered
mind. These many days she
has lived in hourly expectation of
some such blow; but it stuns her
when it comes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Forlorn! forlorn! wondering if it
is possible to hide this misery from
every eye—pondering plans and
schemes of concealment, trying to invent—do
not wonder, it is a natural
impulse—some generous lie. But
Menie’s nature, more truthful than her
will, fails in the effort. The time
goes on, the lingering moments swell
into an hour. Music is in her ears,
and smiling faces glide before her
and about her, till she feels this dreadful
pressure at her heart no longer
tolerable, and bursts away in a sudden
passion, craving to be alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another heart, restless by reason
of a gnawing unhappiness, wanders
out and in of these unlighted chambers—oftenest
coming back to this
one, where the treasures of its life
rest night by night. This wandering
shadow is not a graceful one—these
pattering, hasty footsteps have nothing
in them of the softened lingering
tread of meditation. No, poor
Jenny, little of sentiment or grace
embellishes your melancholy—yet it
is hard to find any poem so full of
pathos as a desolate heart, even such
a one as beats in your homely breast
to-night.</p>

<p class='c010'>Softly—the room is not vacant now,
as it was when you last entered here.
Some one stands by the window, stooping
forward to look at the stars; and
while you linger by the door, a low
cry, half a sigh, half a moan, breaks
the silence faintly—not the same voice
which just now bore its part so well
below;—not the same, for that voice
came from the lips only—this is out
of the heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bairn, you’re no weel—they’ve
a’ wearied you,” said Jenny, stealing
upon her in the darkness: “lie down
and sleep; it’s nae matter for the like
of me, but when you sigh, it breaks
folk’s hearts.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The familiar voice surprised the
watcher into a sudden burst of childish
tears. All the woman failed in
this great trial. “Oh, Jenny, dinna
tell my mother!” Menie Laurie was
capable of no other thought.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE RUSSIAN CHURCH AND THE PROTECTORATE IN TURKEY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Before many weeks shall have gone
over, perhaps while these sheets are
passing through the press, we shall
be able to judge of the accuracy of
Lord Ellenborough’s opinion, as expressed
in the House of Lords on the
6th February, that we are on the eve
of one of the most formidable wars that
ever this country was engaged in.
Yes; within a short period from the
present date much will be known; the
Russian problem will be near its solution.
The mystery of that force,
which is said to be irresistible, and of
those resources said to be inexhaustible,
will be laid bare to the world.
We shall know if all that we have
been told of that vast power which
has kept Europe in awe, is real; if the
colossal idol which all have gazed on
with a feeling that cannot be accurately
described, does not stand on feet of
clay. We confess that recent events
have somewhat weakened the general
faith in the overwhelming strength of
Russia, and people begin to have some
doubt whether the world has not been
imposed upon. With her vast territorial
extent, including nearly one-seventh
part of the terrestrial portion
of the globe and one twenty-seventh
of its entire surface, and her varied
population, comprising nearly one-ninth
of the human race, she has
spoken as if she could domineer over
all Europe; and until the Pruth was
passed, and the Danube became once
more the theatre of battle, mankind
seemed, if not entirely to admit, at
least unwilling to dispute the claim.
The combats of Oltenitza and Citale
have, we suspect, disturbed that belief.
Foreign and all but hostile
flags have, within the last few weeks,
floated almost within sight of Sebastopol;
the squadrons of England and
France have swept the hitherto unapproachable
Euxine, from the Thracian
Bosphorus to Batoun, and from
Batoun back to Beicos Bay, and her
fleet has not ventured to cross their
path. Should Austria, listening to
her evil genius, prove false to her
own interests, we believe that the anticipations
of the noble Lord referred
to will be realised. Should she consult
her own safety, and make common
cause with those whose warlike preparations
are not for aggression, but
defence, we still incline to the opinion
that hostilities may be limited to their
original theatre—to be temporarily
arrested, if not closed, by diplomatic
intervention. The unsuccessful issue,
at least to the date at which we write,
of Count Orloff’s mission, gives us
some hope that such will be the case;
but a very short time will enable us
to judge whether the advance of a
<i><span lang="fr">corps d’armée</span></i> to the Servian frontier
is to aid Russian aggression, or to
act, if necessary, against it.</p>

<p class='c010'>An aggressive spirit has invariably
marked the policy of Russia from the
time of Peter the Great. Long harassed
by internal enemies, and sometimes
struggling for existence, she at
length was freed from the dangers
which had menaced her from abroad.
By a fortunate concurrence of circumstances,
the moment when her government
became constituted, and began
to enjoy its liberty of action, the neighbouring
states, from the Baltic to the
Caspian, entered into their period of
weakness. The wild ambition and
the mad enterprise of Charles XII.
occasioned the decline of Sweden.
The chivalrous monarch, the conqueror
of Narva, the vanquished of Pultova,
perished in the ditch of Frederickshall.
Peter triumphed over his most formidable
enemy; and, if he did not
from that moment begin his aggression
in the Ottoman territory, he was at all
events no longer embarrassed by the
dangerous diversions in the north.
There still, however, remained an obstacle
to his designs on those magnificent
possessions of the Osmanlis, which
have at all times possessed the fatal
privilege of attracting the cupidity of
the northern barbarian. There still
remained Poland; but her anarchy,
her internal convulsions, inseparable
from her anomalous institutions, proved
to be no less profitable to the
Muscovite than the madness of the
Scandinavian hero; and from the day
of her dismemberment, Turkey became
the permanent object of the ambition
which, even as we write, threatens to
convulse Europe.</p>

<p class='c010'>It rarely happens that up to the close
of a long war the original cause of
quarrel continues the same. The first
dissension disappears as war progresses,
and, in the numerous complications
which hostilities give rise to,
the belligerents themselves either forget,
or do not assign the same importance
to the question which originally
arrayed them in arms against each
other. Though the war between
Russia and Turkey has not yet a
remote date, and though hostilities
have not yet been formally declared
between Russia and the Western
Powers, notwithstanding the recall of
their respective ambassadors, we still
fear that the public is beginning to
lose sight of the primary grounds of
quarrel between the Czar and the
Sultan, and which has led to the
present state of things. The pretext
put forward by Russia for intervention
in the Ottoman empire is her desire
to “protect” the ten millions of Christians
of the Greek Church who are
subjects of the Porte; these ten millions
professing the same faith as the
subjects of the Emperor of Russia, and
living under the tyrannous rule of an
infidel government. We admit the
plausibility of that claim, and we are
aware how easily the generous sympathies
of a Christian people can be
roused in favour of such a cause.
We can appreciate the feelings of those
who are persuaded that the moment
has at length arrived when the Cross
shall be planted on the mosques of
Stamboul, and the orthodox believer
take the place of the Mussulman.
The claim to a Protectorate over ten
millions of suffering Greeks in the
European territory of the Sultan has
been described as a cover, under which
Russia aims at the possession of
Constantinople, and, in fact, at the
extension of her dominion from the
Carpathian to the Danube, and from
the Danube to the Sea of Marmora;
but the Czar has solemnly and repeatedly
declared that he had no such
ambition, and that the sole motive
which actuated him was to protect a
population who professed the self-same
religion as himself, he being the visible
head of the Eastern Church, and recognised
as such by the Eastern or
Greek Christians; and the refusal of
the Porte to grant that Protectorate
is the primary cause of the war.
Without examining whether any, or
what conditions would justify a foreign
government in imposing its protection
on the subjects of an independent
state, we may be permitted to say
something of the nature of the religion
whose champion the Czar professes
to be; of the alleged homogeneity
of the Eastern and Russian
Churches, for on this the whole
question turns; and of the advantages
likely to accrue to the Greeks from
Russian protection.</p>

<p class='c010'>Among the many errors likely to
be dissipated by the minute discussion
which the Eastern question has
undergone in the public press of this
and other countries, not the least is
that which has reference to the Emperor
of Russia as the natural Protector
of the Christian communities
of the East. The hardihood with which
this claim has been constantly put forward,
and the silent acquiescence with
which it seems to have been admitted
by those who should know better, have
imposed upon the world. Even now,
they who resist the formal establishment
of the influence of Russia over
the internal affairs of Turkey, do so
more by reason of the political consequences
of that usurpation to the rest
of Europe, than with the thought of
disputing the abstract right of the head
of the “Orthodox Faith” to the Protectorate
he lays claim to. These
pretensions, like many others we could
mention, will not stand the test of examination.
We do not learn, on any
satisfactory evidence, that the Christian
populations of the Ottoman empire
have, during the last ten months,
received with sympathy or encouragement
the prospect of Russian
protection; nor have they, so far as
we know, exhibited any very earnest
longing for the introduction of the
knout as an element of government.
The population of independent Greece
may, and, we have no doubt, do, indulge
in the harmless dream of a new
Byzantine empire to be raised on the
ruins of that which Mahomet II. won
from their fathers; and they would
doubtless rejoice that the domination
of the Osmanlis were put an end to
by Russia, or any other power, on
condition of being their successors,
as they were their predecessors. We
believe that to this sort of revolution
the aspirations of the Greeks
are limited. But that people dispute
the claim of the Czar to the Pontificate
of the “Orthodox Faith,” and
reject the idea of a temporal submission
to him. The Greek Church, however,
does not constitute the only
Christian community of the Ottoman
empire. Other congregations are to be
found there, subjects also of the Porte,
and who have not less claim to the
protection of the various states of
Europe, when protection is needed;
but who still less desire that Russia
should be their sole protector.</p>

<p class='c010'>The points of difference between the
Greek and Latin Churches are familiar
to the world. But it may not be
so generally known that, while the
Russian branch of the former professes
to preserve the Byzantine dogmas
as its basis, the condition of its
hierarchy, and the mechanism of its
discipline, have become so altered with
the lapse of years, that, at the present
day, there exists no identity in this
respect that would justify the head of
the Russian Church in his pretensions
to a temporal or spiritual protectorate
over that church whose administrator
and head is the Patriarch of Constantinople.
Besides the difference of language,
which is not without its importance—the
one speaking Greek,
the other Sclavonic—the Church of
Constantinople still boasts that she
has preserved her Patriarch, who is
independent of secular interference
in spirituals, while no such privilege
belongs to Russia. A serious
difference, too, exists between the
Russian and Greek Churches (and
one which would create new schisms
and new convulsions) on the important
question of baptism. Converts
are admitted into the pale of the former
from other communities, when
they have been already baptized, without
the obligation of again receiving
the sacrament; while the Church of
Constantinople makes the repetition
of the sacrament indispensable in similar
cases. The difference of church
government is of the greatest importance:
the Greeks have never admitted
that the Holy Synod of St Petersburg,
established by Peter the Great,
represents in any sense the spiritual
authority which he forcibly overthrew.
The substitution of the chief of the
state for it was never pretended to be
otherwise than for political purposes,
and as a means of realising the ambitious
and aggressive designs of the
Czar; and, while we do not deny the
success it has met with, we believe that,
since that event, the Russian clergy, as
a body, has become the most ignorant
and the most servile of any ecclesiastical
corporation that now exists. The
edict of Peter the Great admits the
merely temporal object he had in view.
“A spiritual authority,” it states,
“which is represented by a corporation,
or college, will never excite in the nation
so much agitation and effervescence
as a single chief of the ecclesiastical
order. The lower classes of the
people are incapable of comprehending
the difference between the spiritual and
secular authority. When they witness
the extraordinary respect and honour
which encompass a supreme pontiff,
their admiration and wonder are so
excited, that they look upon the chief
of the Church as a second sovereign,
whose dignity is equal, or even superior,
to that of the monarch himself;
and they are disposed to attach to
the ecclesiastical rank a character of
power superior to the other. Now, as
it is incontestable that the common
people indulge in such reflections,
what, we ask, would be the case if
the unjust disputes of an arbitrary
clergy were added to light up a conflagration?”
At the time this edict
was issued, the Russian Church had
already lost its patriarch. Full twenty
years had elapsed since that event;
and if ever the mitre of a prelate
rivalled the diadem of an emperor, it
was not in the reign of Peter that such
an instance was to be found. No serious
antagonism of the kind did or
could exist in Russia; and the real
object of the abolition of the patriarchate
was, to combine with the absolutism
of the sovereign the prestige
of spiritual supremacy—that the Czar
might not only say, with Louis XIV.,
“The State! <em>I</em> am the State;” but
also, “The Church! I am the Church.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Holy Synod of St Petersburg
is, it is true, composed of some of the
highest dignitaries of the Russian
Church, (taken from the monastic
order); but these are appointed by the
secular authority; are presided over by
a layman who represents the Czar, and
whose <em>veto</em> can suspend, or even annul,
the most solemn resolutions of
the Synod, even when <em>unanimously</em>
adopted. The person who occupied
for years, and who, we believe, still
occupies the important post of President
of the Supreme Ecclesiastical
Council, which regulates and decides
on all matters concerning the discipline
and administration of the Church
of Russia, is a general of cavalry—General
Protuson! The body thus
controlled by a military chief, may be
increased in numbers, or reduced, according
to the pleasure of the Czar;
but those who ordinarily constitute
that Ecclesiastical Board are the metropolitan
of St Petersburg, the archbishops,
a bishop, the Emperor’s confessor,
an archimandrite (one degree
lower than a bishop), the chaplain-general
of the naval and military
forces, and an arch-priest. But, whatever
be the rank, the learning, or the
piety of the Synod, one thing must
be well understood by them;—they
must never dare to express an opinion,
or give utterance to a thought,
in opposition to the Czar. The edicts
of the Synod bear the imperial impress;
they are invariably headed
with this <em>formula</em>, “By the most
high will, command, and conformably
to the sublime wishes of his Majesty,
&#38;c. &#38;c.” If it be alleged that the
authority of the Holy Synod, with its
bearded, booted, and <em>sabred</em> president,
relates merely to the temporal
administration of the Church, and
that should a question of dogma arise
recourse would be had to an <em>Œcumenical
Council</em>, composed of all the
churches of the Oriental rite, we reply
that the superintendence of the Synod
is <em>not</em> confined to points of mere administration
or discipline. The canonisation
of a saint, for instance, is
not a matter of mere administration.
When a subject is proposed for that
distinction—and the Russian Hagiology
is more scandalously filled than
the Roman in the worst times of the
Papacy—it is the Synod, that is, the
Emperor, who decides on the claims
to worship of the unknown candidate,
whose remains may have been previously
sanctified by the gross superstition
of a barbarous peasantry. It is
true that, in consequence of some notorious
criminals having, not many
years ago, been added to the list of
orthodox saints, the Emperor, since the
discovery of this, has manifested considerable
repugnance to exercising this
important part of his pontifical functions.
He has, on recent occasions, refused
his <em>fiat</em> of canonisation. A few
years ago, some human bones were dug
up on the banks of a stream in the
government of Kazan, which, for some
reason or other, were supposed to possess
miraculous powers. A cunning
speculator thought it a regular godsend;
and petitions were forthwith
sent to St Petersburg claiming divine
honours for the unknown. The petitions
were repeatedly rejected, but as
often pressed on the Emperor. His
Pontifical Majesty, who was assured,
on high authority, that the claims of
the present candidate were quite as
well founded as those of many in the
<em>Hagiology</em>, at last consented to issue
his order of canonisation, but roundly
swore that he would not grant another
saintship as long as he lived. Yet
it is not doubted that the opportunity
offered by the present “holy war” of
continuing the sacred list will be made
use of unsparingly.</p>

<p class='c010'>In other Churches the sacerdotal
character is indelible; it is conferred
by the ecclesiastical authority, and
whether by the imposition of hands,
or any other formality, cannot be destroyed
even where the party is suspended
from his sacred functions, or
prohibited altogether from performing
them. But neither suspension, nor
degradation, can be considered as a
matter of mere administration, or ordinary
discipline; and the Emperor’s
military representative has it in his
power to decide on the degradation
of any clergyman, and to completely
efface the sacerdotal character acquired
by ordination.</p>

<p class='c010'>But, supposing the improbable event
of an <em>Œcumenical Council</em>, in which
the various Churches of the East
should enter as component parts, in
what manner, we may be permitted
to ask, would the Russians claim to
be represented? Would the Patriarch
of Constantinople, or those of Antioch,
Jerusalem, and Alexandria, who
are under his spiritual jurisdiction,
and who pronounce the Muscovite
Church as, if not heretical, at least
schismatical, submit to be presided
over by an aide-de-camp of the Czar;
or would they recognise, in favour of
his Majesty, the quality of impeccability,
or infallibility, which they refuse
to the head of the Latin Church?</p>

<p class='c010'>With that complete dependence in
spiritual as in temporal government on
the chief of the State, and that debasing
servitude of the Russian Church, may
be compared with advantage the immunities
and privileges of the Church
of Constantinople even under the Mussulman
government. Its Patriarch is
the chief of the Greek communities, the
president of their Synod, and the sovereign
judge, without interference on
the part of the Sultan’s authority, of
all civil and religious matters relating
to these communities which may be
brought before it. The Patriarch, and
the twelve metropolitans who, under
his presidency, compose the Synod,
or Grand Council of the Greek <em>nation</em>,
are exempt from the <em>Haratch</em>, or personal
impost. The imposts the Greek
<em>nation</em> pays to the government are
apportioned, not by the Mussulman
authorities, but by its own archbishops
and bishops. Those prelates are <i><span lang="la">de
officio</span></i> members of the municipal councils,
by the same right as the Turkish
governors and muftis. The cadis and
governors are bound to see to the execution
of the decisions or judgments
of the bishops, in all that relates to
their dioceses respectively; and to
enforce the payment of the contributions
which constitute the ecclesiastical
revenues. The clergy of the
Greek Church receive from each family
of their own communion an annual
contribution, for the decent maintenance
of public worship. They celebrate
marriages, pronounce divorces,
draw up wills, and from all these
acts derive a considerable revenue;
and, in certain cases, they are authorised
to receive legacies bequeathed
for pious objects. For every judgment
pronounced by their tribunals,
the Patriarch and metropolitans are
entitled to a duty on the value of the
property in litigation, of ten per cent.
They have the power of sentencing
to fine, to imprisonment, to corporal
punishment, and to exile, independently
of the spiritual power they possess,
and which they not rarely exercise,
of excommunication. The Patriarch
and the prelates are paid a fixed
contribution by the priests to whom
the higher functions of the ministry
are confided; and these, in turn, receive
a proportional amount from the
clergy under their immediate superintendence.
The incomes of the Patriarchs
of Jerusalem, Antioch, and
Alexandria, of the thirty-two archbishops,
and the one hundred and forty
bishops of the Ottoman empire, are paid
out of these public contributions.</p>

<p class='c010'>These immunities present, as we have
said, a striking contrast with the condition
of the orthodox Church in Russia.
A Church so endowed, and with powers
over the millions who belong to its
communion, would naturally tempt
an ambitious sovereign to become its
master under the name of Protector.
We discard completely any inquiry
into the relative merits of the two
communities; but we think it must be
evident to any impartial mind, that
the protectorate of the Czar, in his
character of head of the orthodox faith,
would make him the supreme ruler
over the Ottoman empire in Europe.</p>

<p class='c010'>We do not mean to allege that the
immunities of the Christian population
have been faithfully respected
by the pashas, the cadis, or other
agents of the Porte. We admit
that most of what has been said
of the intolerance and the corruption
of Turkish officials is true, and
that acts of oppression and cruelty
have been perpetrated, which call for
the severest reprehension, and require
the interference of the Christian
governments of Europe. But what
we dispute is, the exclusive right of
the Emperor of Russia to such intervention
or to such protectorate.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Church of Constantinople regards
that of St Petersburg as schismatical,
however nearly they approach
in some respects; and so far from acknowledging
a right of Protectorate,
either in the Synod or the Emperor,
she claims over her younger and erring
sister all that superiority which is
imparted by primogeniture. She
would reject the claim of Russia to
supremacy, and refuse to be administered
by a servile Synod, with a nominee
of the Czar for President. To
submit to that Protectorate would be
to admit foreign authority; that admission
would involve the loss of her
Patriarch, the evidence of her independence;
and to this conviction may
be traced the indifference of the Greek
population to Russian influence, and
the co-operation its clergy has given
to the Porte.</p>

<p class='c010'>But, scattered amid the immense
population which are subject to the
Sultan, may be found communions
not belonging to the Confession of
Photius as adopted by the Eastern
Churches, and still less to the schismatical
branch of it which is known as
the Russian Church. These communions
have no relation, affinity, or in
fact anything whatever in common
with the Synod of St Petersburg, or
the Czar, whom they regard as a
spiritual usurper, and the creed he
professes as all but heretical. The
Eutychian Armenians amount to no
less than 2,400,000 persons, of whom
nearly 80,000 are actually united to the
Latin Church; but, whatever be the
difference in dogma or ceremonial between
them, they unite in opposition
to the Synod of St Petersburg, and in
submission to the Porte. There are
moreover, upwards of a million of
Roman Catholics and united Greeks—that
is, Greeks who admit the supremacy
of the Pope, while observing
their own ceremonial, and who, it will
not be questioned, have an equal
right to protection, where protection
is requisite. We can easily understand
the interference of the European
powers on behalf of those
communities among whom are to be
found persons of the same religious
belief as themselves; but we cannot
understand on what grounds an <em>exclusive</em>
claim is put forward by a power
which can have no sympathy with
them, and which has destroyed the
most important link that connected the
Church of St Petersburg with that of
the Patriarch. The possession of
Constantinople by the Russians would,
we are convinced, be followed by the
destruction of the independence of
the Eastern Church, the substitution
of some Russian general or admiral,
Prince Menschikoff perhaps, or Prince
Gortschakoff, or whoever may happen
to be the favourite of the day, for the
venerable Patriarch; and by the most
cruel persecution, not perhaps so much
from religious intolerance, as for the
same reasons assigned by Peter the
Great for his abolition of the patriarchal
dignity. The treatment of the
united Greeks of the Russian empire,
the Catholics of Poland and of the
Muscovite provinces, is sufficient to
show to those who, <em>now</em> at all events,
live tranquilly under the rule of the Sultan,
what they have to expect from the
tolerance, the equity, or the mercy of
such a Russian Protector. One-fourth
of the Latin population ruled over by
the Czar is made up of various religious
sects and forms of worship—Catholicism,
Lutheranism, Calvinism,
Mahometanism, Judaism, Lamaism,
Schamaism, &#38;c. In theory these different
persuasions have a right to toleration;
but in practice the case is different.
The jealousy of the Czars, and
their determination to reduce all that
comes within their grasp to the same
dead level of servitude, cannot endure
a difference of any kind, religious or political;
and pretexts are never wanting
for persecutions, which have been
compared to those of the worst days of
the Roman emperors. The Baltic provinces,
Lithuania and Poland, testify
to the truth of these allegations. It
appears clear, then, that the Christian
communities of the Ottoman empire
do not require the protection or domination
of Russia, which would crush
all alike.</p>

<p class='c010'>We beg to point out another, and
a material error into which the generality
of people have fallen with reference
to the Christian population of
Turkey in Europe. The oppression of
a Christian people by a misbelieving
despotism is sufficient, of itself, to enlist
the sympathies of a civilised and tolerant
nation; and the fact of that oppression
being practised by a small
minority over a multitude composing
three-fourths of the population of the
Ottoman empire in Europe, is denounced
as a monstrous anomaly; and the
public indignation has been roused at
the idea of scarcely three millions and
a half of Turks grinding to the dust
more than ten millions of Christians.
We execrate religious oppression as
much as any one can do; and whether
the persecuted be numerous or few,
one or one thousand, the crime is, in
principle, the same. But we can show
that, in the present instance, the
aggravating circumstance of so great
a difference in numbers does not
exist. Those who speak of ten
millions of Greek Christians being
oppressed by three millions of Turks,
forget, or may not be aware, that
Moldavia and Wallachia, known as
the Danubian Principalities, and now
“protected” to the utmost by synods
of another kind from that of St Petersburg—by
military tribunals, and
martial law—contain a population of
above four millions, all of whom, with
the exception of about fifty thousand
Hungarian Catholics, are members of
the Greek, though not of the Russo-Greek
Church. Now, the Moldo-Wallachians
are, in their domestic
administration, independent of the
Porte, the tie which attaches them to
it—the payment of a comparatively
small tribute—being of the slenderest
kind. The Principalities are governed
by their own princes or hospodars,
formerly named for life, and, since
the convention of 1849 between Russia
and the Porte, for seven years;
they are selected from among their
own boyards, and receive investiture
only from the Sultan. The Moldo-Wallachian
army is recruited from the
Moldo-Wallachian population, and is
organised on the Russian plan, with
Russian staff-officers. In neither of
the three provinces is there a Turkish
garrison, nor a Turkish authority of
any kind, nor a single Turkish soldier;
there is consequently no Turkish
oppression or persecution. Servia,
with a population of about a million,
mostly Christians of the Greek communion,
is equally independent of the
Porte. The Turks have, it is true, a
garrison in Belgrade, limited, by treaty
with Austria, to a certain force; and
Belgrade itself is the residence of a
Pasha; but, beyond this trifling military
occupation, the acknowledgment,
as a matter of form, of the supremacy
of the Sultan, and a small tribute in
money, nothing else is left them. And,
as in the case of the Danubian provinces,
the internal government is
entirely in the hands of the Servians
themselves. The liberal institutions
established in Servia by Prince Milosch
Obrenowitsch, were not disturbed or
interfered with by the Porte, to which
they gave no umbrage, but were overthrown
by Russian intrigue. In
Servia no oppression, no persecution,
is or can be practised by the Turks,
who are powerless. Thus, we have
about five millions of population to
be deducted from the ten millions said
to be mercilessly oppressed, outraged,
and persecuted by Mussulman bigotry;—and
also said to be eager for the
religious Protectorate of Russia.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Danubian Principalities were
formerly governed by princes called
<em>waywodes</em>, who were appointed by the
Sultan. Those waywodes, it is true,
exercised every species of oppression;
but our readers will perhaps be surprised
when they learn that these provincial
tyrants were <em>not</em> Mussulmans:
they were <em>Christians</em>, and Christians
of the same communion as the people
whom they ruled over; and they were
selected because they were Christians,
to administer Christian dependencies.
The waywodes were Fanariote Greeks,
and denizens of Constantinople. We
do not deny that the Turkish government
were bound to see that their provinces
were properly administered;
but they were powerless to repress
these abuses, as they were powerless
to repress the abuses in the Turkish
Pashalicks.</p>

<p class='c010'>The influence of Russia for a long
time, and particularly for the last
twenty-five years, has been paramount
in the Danubian Principalities.
We have shown that the Moldo-Wallachians,
with a slight exception, prefer
the Greek rite; but there is no
evidence that they have any religious
sympathies with the Church of which
the Emperor of Russia is the head.
The Moldo-Wallachians also regard
the Russian dogmas as schismatic,
and recognise only the religious supremacy
of the Patriarch of Constantinople.
In Paris there is a Russian
chapel for the use of the Russian
embassy, the residents of that nation,
and the few subjects of Independent
Greece who may think it proper, or
useful, to attend Russian worship.
The Moldo-Wallachians who also
reside in the French capital have
been often pressed to attend that
chapel, with a view, no doubt, to
establish in the eyes of the world a
homogeneity which in reality does
not exist. As a proof of the antipathy
between the two communions, we
quote a passage from a discourse
delivered on the occasion of the opening
of a temporary place of worship
for the Moldo-Wallachians by the
Archimandrite Suagoano. To those
who still believe that there exists the
bond of a common faith between the
Church of Constantinople and that of
St Petersburg, and that the Moldo-Wallachians,
or the Greeks of the
Ottoman empire, desire a Russian
Protectorate, we recommend the perusal
of the following, which was pronounced
to a numerous congregation
in the beginning of January last.
“When we expressed a desire,” said
the archimandrite, “to found a chapel
of our own rite, we were told that a
Russian chapel already existed in
Paris, and we were asked why the
Roumains (Moldo-Wallachians) do
not frequent it? What! Roumains
to frequent a Russian place of worship!
Is it then forgotten that they
can never enter its walls, and that
the Wallachians who die in Paris,
forbid, at their very last hour, that
their bodies should be borne to a Muscovite
chapel, and declare that the
presence of a Russian priest would be
an insult to their tomb. Whence
comes this irreconcilable hatred? That
hatred is perpetuated by the difference
of language. The Russian tongue
is Sclavonic; <em>ours</em> is Latin. Is there
in fact a single Roumain who understands
the language of the Muscovites?
That hatred is just; for is not Russia
our mortal enemy? Has she not
closed up our schools, and debarred
us from all instruction, in order to
sink our people into the depths of
barbarism, and to reduce them the
more easily to servitude? On that
hatred I pronounce a blessing; for
the Russian Church is a schism which
the Roumains reject; because the
Russian Church has separated from
the great Eastern Church; because
the Russian Church does not recognise
as its head the Patriarch of Constantinople;
because it does not receive
the Holy Unction of Byzantium;
because it has constituted
itself into a Synod of which the Czar
is the despot; and because that
Synod, in obedience to his orders, has
changed its worship, has fabricated
an unction which it terms holy, has
suppressed or changed the fast days,
and the Lents as established by our
bishops; because it has canonised
Sclavonians who are apocryphal
saints, such as Vladimir, Olga, and
so many others whose names are unknown
to us; because the rite of
Confession, which was instituted to
ameliorate and save the penitent, has
become, by the servility of the Muscovite
clergy, an instrument for spies
for the benefit of the Czar; in fine,
because that Synod has violated the
law, and that its reforms are arbitrary,
and are made to further the
objects of despotism. These acts of
impiety being so notorious, and those
truths so known, who shall now maintain
that the Russian Church is not
schismatic? Our Councils reject it;
our canons forbid us to recognise it;
our Church disavows it; and all who
hold to the faith, and whom she recognises
for her children, are bound
to respect her decision, and to consider
the Russian rite as a schismatic rite.
Such are the motives which prevent
the Roumains from attending the
Russian chapel in Paris!” This address
was received with enthusiasm
by the assemblage. Letters of felicitation
have been received by the archimandrite
from his unhappy brethren
of the Principalities, who are driven
with the bayonet to the churches to
chant <i><span lang="la">Te Deum</span></i> for Russian victories;
and, impoverished as they are, the
prelates and priests of Wallachia send
their mites to Paris, to aid in the construction
of a true Greek church.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>It would be unjust to charge any
religious community with the responsibility
of the crimes or vices of individual
members. The police offices
and law courts in our own country
occasionally disclose cases of moral
depravity among members of the
clerical profession; but these cases
are few, we are happy to say, in comparison
with the number of pious and
learned men that compose the body.
Nor do we pronounce a sweeping
anathema on the Russo-Greek Church,
because, with the exception of, as we
are informed, a few of the superior
dignitaries, no ecclesiastical corporation
can produce more examples of
gross ignorance and vicious habits.
The degradation, the miserable condition
of the mass of the Russian
clergy, the pittance they receive from
the State, being insufficient to keep
body and soul together, and the almost
total want of instruction, are, no
doubt, the cause of this state of things.
Marriage is a primary and indispensable
condition for the priesthood;
and the death of the wife, unless
where a special exemption is accorded
by the Synod or the Emperor, involves
not merely the loss of his sacerdotal
functions, but completely annuls
the priestly character. The widowed
priest returns to a lay condition from
that moment; he may become a field
labourer, or a valet; a quay porter,
or a groom; a mechanic, or a soldier
of the army of Caucasus; but his
functions at the altar cease then, and
for ever. The irregularities which in
Russia, as elsewhere, prevailed in the
monastic establishments, afforded a
pretext to that rude reformer, Peter
the Great, for abolishing the greater
number of them. Their immense
wealth, the gifts of the piety or
the superstition of past ages, was
a temptation which the inexorable
despot could not resist; and having
once acquired a taste for plunder,
he appropriated not only monastic property,
whilst abolishing monasteries,
but filled the imperial treasury with
the confiscated wealth of the secular
clergy. What Peter left undone
Catherine II. completed. During
the reign of that Princess, whose own
frailties might have taught her sympathy
for human weaknesses, the
whole of the remaining immovable
property of the Church was seized.
The correspondent and friend of Voltaire
and the Encyclopedists filled
with joy the hearts of the philosophers
of Paris, by the appropriation
of the resources of superstition, which
she devoted to the realisation of her
ambitious projects, or to recompense
richly the services of her numerous
favourites. Miserable pittances were
allotted to the functionaries to whom
that great wealth had belonged; but
the distractions of love and war too
often interfered with the payment of
even those pittances. In Moscow, St
Petersburg, and some other large
cities, there are still, perhaps, a few
benefices which afford a decent subsistence
to the holders; but the stipends,
even when augmented by the
<i><span lang="fr">casuel</span></i>, the chance and voluntary contribution
paid by individuals for special
masses, and certain small perquisites
for funerals, &#38;c., are insufficient
to maintain, in anything approaching
to comfort, a single, much
less a married clergyman. There appears
to be some difference of opinion
among the best authorities on the
exact stipends received by the higher
clergy. The income of the senior
metropolitan, the first dignitary of
the orthodox church, including all
sources of revenue, has never been
estimated at more than from £600 to
£700 per annum; that of the other
metropolitans, at about £160; of an
archbishop, £120; of a bishop, £80;
of an archimandrite, the next in rank
after a bishop, from £40 to £50. The
wooden hut inhabited by a parish
priest is not superior to that of the
poorest of his parishioners, and the
spot of land attached is cultivated by
his own hands. The destitute condition
of the inferior clergy has many
times been brought under the notice
of the government, and commissioners
have been named to examine into
the complaints, but without producing
any result.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under such circumstances, it is not
extraordinary that the clergy should
become degraded in the eyes of the
people, and be regarded, when not
in the performance of their sacred
functions, as objects of derision and
contempt. With starvation at home,
they are forced to seek in the houses
of others what their own cannot
supply; to satisfy the most pressing
wants of nature, they submit to
scoff and insult; and wherever feasting
is going on, the priest is found
an unbidden, and in most instances
an unwelcome guest. This state of
life leads to vagrant, idle, and dissolute
habits, and it is declared, on what
appears to be competent authority,
that intemperance is the general characteristic
of the lower clergy of
Russia. Intemperance easily leads
to other vices. According to official
reports laid before the Synod, there
were, in the single year 1836, 208
ecclesiastics degraded for <em>infamous
crimes</em>, and 1985 for crimes or offences
less grave. In that year the clergy comprised
102,456 members;—the number
degraded and sentenced by the tribunals
was therefore about two per cent.
In 1839, the number of priests condemned
by the tribunal was one out
of twenty; and during the three years
from 1836 to 1839 inclusive, the cases
were 15,443, or one-sixth of the whole.
A good deal of scandal, as well there
might be, was occasioned by the reports
of the Synod, and that body received
a hint to be more discreet in
exposing to the sneers of the heterodox
the state of the orthodox church.
It attempted, in a subsequent report,
to explain away or palliate those disorders.
“If such things,” says the
Synodical Report of 1837, “cannot be
entirely avoided by reason of the vast
extent of the empire; of the want of
seminaries, attendance at which has
been only recently obligatory; of the
little instruction received by the
clergy, who in this respect are, as it
were, in a state of infancy—so much
so, that one old barbarism has not
yet disappeared—nevertheless, the
same clergy has exhibited rich examples
of ancient piety and severity
of morals.” Dr Pinkerton assures us
that there are to be found among the
families of the parochial clergy, a degree
of culture and good manners peculiar
to themselves. If we can rely
on accounts more recent, and quite as
good, these are but rare exceptions;
and we fear that matters are pretty
much the same as when Coxe was
in Russia, and many of the parish
priests were so ignorant as to be unable
to read, even in their own language,
the gospel they were commissioned
to preach. M. de Haxthausen,
whose testimony is entitled to great
respect, says, “Ecclesiastics of merit
are rare in the country. The greater
number of the old popes are ignorant,
brutal, without any instruction, and
exclusively given up to their personal
interests. In the performance of religious
ceremonies, and in the dispensation
of the sacraments, they have
often no other object in view than to
obtain presents. They have no care
about the spiritual welfare of their
flocks, and impart neither consolation
nor instruction to them.” This ignorance,
added to relaxed morals, accounts
for their want of influence with
the people, who are in the habit of
treating them with the most contemptuous
familiarity. The lower classes
have special sarcasms and insulting
proverbs applicable to their popes.</p>

<p class='c010'>The higher ranks of the Russian
clergy are principally, we believe exclusively,
taken from the <em>Tschernoi Duhovenstvo</em>,
or black clergy—monks who
live in convents, and pass their lives
in the practice of religious observances.
Their superiority to the
secular clergy is in all respects considerable,
and whatever of instruction
exists among the priesthood
must be sought for in the retreats of
the Basilians—the only order of
monks, we believe, in Russia. They
live, however, apart from the people;
they have no direct intercourse with
them; they are ignorant, or regardless,
of their material or moral wants;
and for them they feel no sympathy
or affection. It must not be supposed
that this superiority over the
parochial or secular clergy, in station
or morals, implies independence, separately
or collectively. Their dependence
on the government differs
not in the least from that of the
most ignorant village pope, or of the
meanest serf. The high functionaries
and dignitaries of the Church are, as
we have already observed, taken from
the monastic body; and as the Synod,
or, which is all the same, the Emperor,
can deprive an ecclesiastic of
his functions, and degrade him to a
lay condition, the metropolitan archbishop,
or bishop, who cares to keep
his mitre, has no other choice than
to be the docile and zealous agent of
the Autocrat. Since the time of
Peter the Great, the whole body of
the Russian clergy, from the highest
to the lowest, have lain grovelling
in the dust at the feet of every tyrant
with the title of Czar or Czarina;
and no other corporation in the world
that we have any knowledge of, lay
or clerical, equals it in hopeless servitude.
Taught from their infancy to
regard the Czar as the sole dispenser
of good and evil, and firmly believing
that every people on the earth trembles
at his name, they scarcely make
any distinction between him and the
Deity; and in their public and private
devotions their adoration is
divided, perhaps not equally, between
God and the Emperor. Those names
are mingled together in the first lessons
they learn, and their awe of the
mortal ruler is more intense than their
love for the Creator. Those ideas
are transmitted by the priests to their
children; and as the ranks of the
clerical body are filled up almost exclusively
from the families of the
popes, ignorance and slavishness become
as traditional and as hereditary
as the office for which they are indispensable.
The jealous fears of the
Autocrat prevent grafting on the old
stock, and he suffers no innovation
of any kind to animate that torpid
mass of bondage.</p>

<p class='c010'>In alluding to the social degradation
of the Russian clergy, it is but
fair to admit that there are certain
privileges attached to that body which
are not accorded to the rest of his
Imperial Majesty’s subjects. The
Czar, out of his mere motion, and by
special favour, the value of which is
no doubt properly appreciated by the
persons interested, has made a difference
in the punishments inflicted on
laymen and on clergymen. The Russian
priest is not liable to be scourged to
death by the <em>knout</em>; nor to be beaten
to a jelly by a club, like the other
members of the orthodox faith. Yet
this privilege, we fear, is more specious
than real. It does not survive
the sacerdotal character; and as this
may be suspended or annihilated at
the pleasure of the Synod, or at the
death of the <em>popess</em>, the exemption
from the <em>knout</em> and the <em>baten</em> is an extremely
uncertain privilege. The rule
of the Russian Church, which makes
the priestly character, indelible in other
communions, to depend on so frail a
tenure as the life of the partner, is
most curious, and must perpetuate
those vices which we have already
noticed. The pastor who loses his
wife must at once abandon his sacred
functions, and set himself to some
other pursuit, if he be still in the
force of health and manhood; if he
be aged or infirm, his lot is hard indeed.
When the sacerdotal office is
forfeited by some very grave offence,
hard labour for life, or the distractions
of a campaign in the Caucasus
in one of the condemned regiments,
with glimpses of the <em>knout</em>, form the
hopeless future of the unhappy wretch
who, but a few months before, was
dispensing the sacraments at the
altar. We may add, that the wives
and widows of the priests, and their
young children, enjoy, by a pious
dispensation of the head of the Church
of Russia, an exemption from the
<em>knout</em>. The children, moreover, are
exempt from the payment of imposts
and military enlistment.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sects that have started into
life since the seventeenth century are
comprised by the established or
official church of Russia in the sweeping
designation of <em>roskolnicki</em>, or
<em>schismatical</em>; but the term is rejected
with indignation by the parties to
whom it is applied. They refuse, as
a base and groundless calumny, the
term <em>schismatical</em>, and claim for their
own special qualification that of <em>Starowertzi</em>,
or <em>Ancient believers</em>. They
have also, no less than their predecessors,
been the object of the severity
of the government. Every opportunity
has been laid hold of to crush
them; and in the revolt of the Strelitz,
not only were ruinous fines imposed
on them, but many of their
leaders were imprisoned, exiled,
hanged, or poniarded, by order of
Peter I. Severity being of no avail,
milder measures were resorted to.
A compromise was proposed in the
reign of Catherine II., and after a
show of examination, several of their
less objectionable doctrines were allowed
to pass muster as orthodox,
and the variations in their liturgy
received, on condition that their
priests submitted to receive orders
from the prelates of the Synod.
As an additional inducement, they
were promised that ordination should
be conferred according to the sectarian,
and not the established rite;
that their usages should be respected,
and no interference take place in the
education of their clergy. But so great
was the animosity that no concession
could win, no kindness soften them,
and the experiment of gaining over
this stray flock to the fold failed
totally. At an earlier period <em>Starowertzi</em>
convents were erected in the
deep recesses of the forests in the
northern provinces of Russia. These
convents were soon demolished, and
their prelates and abbots banished, or
otherwise removed. Yet for many
years their religious necessities were
supplied by priests ordained by the
<em>Starowertzi</em> bishops; and, since their
death, pastors are recruited from the
many seceders from the orthodox
church. In spite of the difficulties
the sect has to contend with, and the
incessant vigilance and rigour of the
authorities, it possesses a mysterious
influence, which is said to be felt even
in the councils of the empire. It is
believed that no important reform is
ever attempted, no change in the internal
administration of the country
takes effect, until the opinions of the
chiefs of this formidable party are ascertained,
and the impression likely to
be made upon the mass of their followers.
In all social relations, in all
matters connected with everyday life
and business, it is affirmed that the
<em>Starowertzi</em> are trustworthy and honourable.
They are not habitually
mendacious or deceitful, like the more
civilised classes of his Imperial Majesty’s
subjects; and the more closely
the lower orders resemble the <em>Starowertzi</em>
the better they are. In education
they are also superior to the mass
of the Russians. Among them there
are few who have not learned to read
and write, though even in the acquisition
of this elementary instruction
their religious prejudices prevail.
They make use only of the Sclavonic
dialect, the modern Russian being
regarded as heretical. They are familiar
with the Bible, and commit
some portions of it to memory, which
they recite with what the French
would term <em>onction</em>; neither are they
despicable opponents to encounter on
the field of theological controversy.
One of the principal seats of <em>Starowertzism</em>
was in the midst of those
vast and dismal swamps which extend
towards the Frozen Ocean, on the
European side of the great Oural
chain, and on the banks of the river
which discharges its waters into the
Caspian; in the government of Saratoff,
more than four hundred miles
to the south-east of Moscow; and
among the Cossack tribes that wander
near the Volga and the Terek,
close to the military line which extends
in front of the Caucasus, are to
be found numerous disciples. But for
many years the great centre of <em>Starowertzism</em>
was on the Irghis. On its
banks four great monasteries once
rose, and their inmates found a never-failing
supply from the deserters of
the army, and the fugitives from the
wilderness and the knout of Siberia.
Priests of the official church, excited
by fanaticism or degraded for their
vices, and monks expelled from their
convents, were received with open
arms as welcome converts. Their
numbers increased so rapidly as to
give serious alarm to the governors,
and in 1838 a <em>razzia</em> was proclaimed
against these religious fortresses.
Strong bodies of troops were sent
against them; the convents were pillaged,
and then given to the flames,
and the inmates were either sent to
the army, or driven into the impenetrable
wilds of Siberia. The doctrines
of the sect have chiefly spread in the
rural districts, and among the lower
classes of tradesmen. In the convents
for females (for <em>Starowertzism</em>
has also its nuns), the only occupation
consists in multiplying copies of
their liturgy, for no religious work is
allowed to be printed. The <em>Starowertzi</em>
divide the inhabitants of the
earth into three great classes—the
<em>Slaves</em>, by them termed <em>Slovaise</em>, or
<em>Speakers</em>; the <em>Nemtzi</em>, or <em>Mutes</em>, whom
they regard as little above heathens;
and all the Orientals are, without
distinction, called by the general designation
of Mussulmans. The rite
of baptism is performed by immersion—they
admit the validity of no
other; but in no case do they recognise
it when administered by the
orthodox Russian, and all converts
must be rebaptised before admission.
It is a curious fact, almost incredible,
were we not assured of its
exactness on good authority, that
though their spiritual directors belong
mostly to the scum of the Russian
clergy—degraded priests or monks—the
<em>Starowertzi</em> are the least immoral
of all the sects into which the
orthodox church has been broken up.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sect which more closely approximates
in fundamentals to the
established church is that which terms
itself the <em>Blagosslowenni</em> (the <em>Blessed</em>);
and so slight is the difference between
them, that in the official nomenclature
they are designated as the <em>Jedinowertzi</em>,
or the <em>Uniform Believers</em>. In
essential points of doctrine the difference
is not great, in some almost imperceptible,
though the ceremonial
varies notably from that which is recognised
by the Holy Synod. They
make the sign of the cross in a different
manner from the orthodox. They
denounce the shaving the beard as a
sin of the greatest enormity. Some
other peculiarities are worth noting:
they repeat the name of Jesus in three
distinct parts; walk in procession in
their places of worship from right to
left, and, taking their ground on the
text of Scripture which says that that
which enters at the mouth is not sinful,
but that which issues from it, they
denounce the practice of smoking as a
crime. There is another point, which
we fear would be unpopular among
our fellow-subjects in Ireland: the
<em>Blessed</em> attribute a diabolical origin to
that useful root the potato, and, what
we believe has been strenuously maintained,
though in a different spirit, by
some Irish antiquarian, they pretend
to prove that the potato was actually
the fruit with which Eve was easily
seduced by the wily serpent, and which
our first mother persuaded her confiding
husband to partake of. This sect
reprobates the reforms attempted by
Peter I., and they are not to this day
reconciled to the Emperor Nicholas
for not wearing the costume, and bearing
the title of the <em>Belvi Tzar</em>, or the
<em>White Czar</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <em>Starrobriadtzi</em>, or the <em>Observers
of the ancient rite</em>, are an offshoot of the
<em>Starowertzi</em>, but are still more exclusive
and intolerant, and much more
hostile to the official church. The
scum of the orthodox priesthood are
sure to find a welcome with them, and
the more degraded they are the better.
Every candidate for admission
must formally recant his previous
heresy—for such they term the orthodox
dogma.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most numerous of all these
sects is one which is termed the <em>Bespopertchine</em>
(<em>Without priests</em>). They
not only reject ordination as conferred
by the orthodox bishop, but dispense
altogether with clergy as a distinct
body. The sect is subdivided into
several fractions, each known by the
name of its founder, such as the <em>Philipperes</em>,
the <em>Theodosians</em>, the <em>Abakounians</em>,
&#38;c., &#38;c. They anticipate
a general conversion of the reprobates,—that
is, all who are not of their sect,
whether Christian or Infidel—by reason
or by force; and believe that the
time is at hand when the errors of
Nicon, the Luther of the Russo-Greek
church, will be solemnly abjured by
Russia; that a regenerated order of
ecclesiastical superintendents will
come from the East, when their own
sect, the only true church of God, will
reign triumphant wherever the name
of Russia is heard. The reign of Antichrist
began with Nicon; it still subsists,
and will endure until the advent
of the Lord, who is to smite the unbelievers,
and scatter the darkness that
envelopes the earth. Though a regularly
ordained priesthood is not recognised,
yet a sort of religious organisation
is admitted by the Philippon
section of it. Instead of the popes of
the orthodox church, they have a class
of men whom they term <em>Stariki</em>, or
<em>Elders</em>, and who are selected from a
number of candidates. The ceremony
of installation consists in a few words
of prayer, and the <em>accolade</em> in the presence
of the congregation. The elders,
who are distinguished by a particular
costume, have no regular stipend, but
subsist entirely on alms. In case of
misconduct, they are not only deprived
of their office, but expelled altogether
from the community. The Philippons
retain the rite of confession; but the
avowal of their sins is made, not to a
living man, but to an image, which
acts by way of conductor to the pardon
which is sent down from heaven.
An elder, however, stands by as a
witness of the confession and forgiveness;
and while the long story of
offences, mortal or venial, is unfolded,
his duty consists in crying out at regular
intervals, “May your sins be
forgiven!” The simple exclamation, in
the presence of three witnesses, that a
man takes a woman to wife, is the
only ceremony required for marriage,
nor is it indispensable that the elder
should be present. The portion of the
Bible translated by Saint Cyril is the
only part of it they retain. Their
doctrine of the procession of the Holy
Ghost is the same as that of the Greek
Church. They believe that the souls
of the dead are sunk in a profound
lethargy from the moment they quit
the body until the general judgment,
to which they will be summoned by
the archangel’s trumpet. On that
awful day the souls of the wicked only
are to resume their bodies, and pass
into eternal fire. Their fasts, which
comprise a third of the year, are of the
strictest. They rigorously abstain
from malt liquors; and though, on
certain specified occasions, wine is
permitted, yet the moderate draught
must be administered from the hand
of one of their own sect. In the matter
of oaths they are quite as rigid as
the Society of Friends. They are distinguished
by no family name, but
only by that received at their birth.
Their differences are all settled before
a tribunal composed of an elder and
two or three of the sect, who must,
however, be fathers of families; and
from this decision there is seldom an
appeal. Between husband and wife
a complete community of goods exists,
and the surviving partner inherits all.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Theodosians do not much differ
from the Philippons. Their women,
however, have a separate place of
worship from the men, where the service
is celebrated by ancient maidens,
called <em>Christova Neviestu</em>, or the <em>Betrothed
of Christ</em>. The Theodosians
have a large hospital in the city of Moscow,
with two magnificent churches.
The former affords accommodation for
more than a thousand patients. Communism
has penetrated into all these
sects. Among the subdivisions of the
great sect of the <em>Starowertzi</em> marriage
is not regarded as a bond which lasts
for life, or which can only be severed
by divorce. A man and woman agree
to live together for one or more years,
as it may suit their convenience.
They separate on the expiry of their
contract, and become free to receive
a similar offer from any one else,
while the issue of such temporary
marriages belongs to the public, without
any special notice from the
parents.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <em>Douchobertzi</em>, or <em>Wrestlers in
Spirit</em>, are, like the <em>Malakani</em>, or <em>Drinkers
of Milk</em>, divided into seven fractions,
and are remarkable for their
hostility to the official church. Their
doctrines consist of the leading points
of the old heresies, and they constitute
a theological system more developed,
though not more uniform,
than any of the previous sects. Some
of their doctrines are so vague, and
so inconsistent, that what is regarded
as fundamental in one district, or
even in one village, is considered as
corrupt or as unimportant in another
not perhaps a league off. Different
from the <em>Starowertzi</em>, who strictly adhere
to traditional observances, they
are incessantly making innovations
in the fundamental doctrines of the
orthodox church. The <em>Starowertzi</em>
are particularly scrupulous about form
and ceremonial; the <em>Douchobertzi</em>, on
the contrary, reject all forms of worship,
and spiritualise the church.
The influence of these spiritualists is
not yet felt to any considerable extent
in Russia. Though offshoots of
the <em>Malakani</em>, or <em>Milk Drinkers</em>, these
two sects hate each other most cordially.</p>

<p class='c010'>The use of milk preparations during
Lent, and on days of rigid abstinence,
explains the name by which the <em>Malakani</em>
are known to their adversaries,
but the designation by which they
describe themselves is <em>Istinie Christiane</em>,
or <em>True Christians</em>. They are
of modern date, and first became
known in the middle of the last century,
when they appeared in the government
of Tambon. They soon
spread into neighbouring governments,
and their most successful proselytism
has been among the peasantry. Three
large villages in the Taurida are entirely
peopled by this sect. Like the
Latin Church, they admit seven sacraments,
but they receive them only
in spirit. As with them the “church”
is merely a <em>spiritual</em> assemblage of
believers, they have no temples for
the celebration of divine worship.
Images they do not tolerate, and
swearing on any account, or in any
form, is severely interdicted. One of
their leading doctrines is, that with
them alone Jesus Christ will reign on
the earth. A precursor of that spiritual
millennium, who assumed to be
the prophet Elias, appeared in 1833.
He exhorted the <em>Malakani</em> to prepare,
by rigid fasting and mortification, for
the advent of the Saviour, which
would take place in two years. A
brother fanatic or accomplice, under
the biblical appellation of Enoch, went
on a similar mission, to announce the
tidings to the barbarians of western
Europe. When the duty of the original
impostor, whose real name was
Beloireor, was accomplished, he announced
his approaching return to
heaven in a chariot. Thousands of
the <em>Malakani</em> assembled to witness
the ascent of the prophet, who presented
himself to the kneeling multitude
clothed in flowing robes of white
and blue, and seated in a car drawn
by white steeds. The new Elias rose,
spread out his arms, and waved them
up and down, as a bird his wings
when preparing to mount into the
sky. He bounded from his chariot,
but instead of soaring gracefully to
the clouds, fell heavily and awkwardly
in the mire, and killed a woman who
stood by clinging to the wheels. The
multitude had fasted, prayed, wept, and
watched, and their imaginations had
become excited to the highest pitch.
Enraged at the disappointment, or
convinced of the imposture of the prophet,
they rose against him, and would
have slain him, had he not contrived
to escape the first burst of their fury.
He was afterwards caught, and, with
more judgment than could be expected
from them, they contented themselves
with handing him over to the
tribunals to pay the penalties of imposture.
He endured a long imprisonment;
but neither his disgrace
nor the fear of the knout prevented
him from predicting to the last day
of his existence the near advent of
the millennium. His persistence conciliated
former, and obtained him new
disciples. They became more numerous
after his death; but the scene of
their labours was changed; they were
forced to emigrate to Georgia, where
they still carry on their propagandism.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a curious fact that, when Napoleon
invaded Russia, the great captain
was regarded by the <em>Malakani</em> as
“the Lion of the Valley of Josaphat,”
whose mission was to overthrow the
“false emperor,” and restore to power
the “White Czar.” A numerous deputation
from the government of Tambon,
preceded by heralds clothed in
white, was sent forth to meet him.
Their privilege did not protect them.
Napoleon, or his marshals, had no
great sympathy with fanatics; they
were considered as prisoners of war:
one only escaped, the others were
never heard of again.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <em>Douchobertzi</em> are the <i><span lang="la">illuminati</span></i>
of Russia, and the term applied to
them by the common people is <em>Yarmacon</em>,
or Free Masons. Though
this sect really dates from the middle
of the eighteenth century, it affects to
trace its origin to a very remote
period, claiming as its founders the
youths who were flung into the furnace
by order of Nebuchadnezzar.
The corruption and fall of the soul of
man, long previous to the creation of
the material world, forms the basis of
their faith. The “Son of God” means
the universal spirit of humanity; and
the assumption of the form of man
was in order that each individual
member of mankind might also possess
the attributes of the Son of God. The
<em>Douchobertzi</em> admit that in the person
of Christ the world has been saved;
but the Christ whose death is recorded
in Holy Writ was not the real Redeemer;
it was not He who made
atonement for man; that belongs only
to the <em>ideal</em> Christ. Forms of worship,
and, of course, temples, are rejected
by them. Each member of the sect
is himself a temple, where the “Eternal”
loves to be glorified, and man
is at once temple, priest, and victim;
or, in other words, the heart is the
altar, the will the offering, and the
spirit of man the pontiff. They are
all equal in the sight of God, and they
admit the supremacy of no creature
on the earth. The more rigorous of
the <em>Douchobertzi</em> carry their severity
of morals to an extreme, and with
them the most innocent and most
necessary recreations are heinous
crimes. But the majority pass to the
other extreme, and strange stories are
told of the orgies practised in secret
under the guise of devotional exercises.
The <em>Douchobertzi</em>, like other
fanatics, expect the triumph of their
own sect over the world. Even
now the fulness of time is nigh at
hand; and when the awful moment
comes, they will rise in their accumulated
and resistless force, and spread
terror over the earth. <em>Their</em> chief
will be the only potentate who shall
reign in unbounded power, and all
mankind will gather round the footsteps
of his throne, bow their heads
to the dust, veil their eyes before the
glory that flashes fiercely from his
brow, and proclaim his boundless
power and his reign without end.
But this triumph must be preceded
by a season of trial and sorrow.
Their Czar must previously undertake
a mighty struggle against all misbelievers.
It will be terrible, but brief;
the <em>Douchobertzi</em> shall, of course, win
the victory, and, in the person of their
chief, mount the throne of the world
to reign for ever and for ever! The
Russian authorities have repeatedly
attempted to crush a sect whose tendencies
are so menacing; but the task
is difficult against a body who have
no acknowledged leader, no priesthood,
and no place of worship. Among
the few puritans who take no pains
to conceal their doctrines, they have
to a certain extent succeeded. One
of the most eminent of them was a
man named Kaponstin, who was
reverenced as a divinity. In consequence
of some dissensions with the
<em>Malakani</em>, to whom he originally belonged,
he separated from them,
preached new and still more extravagant
doctrines. Numerous proselytes
quitted with him their old villages,
and took up their abode in the
Taurida. There they founded nine
villages, which a few years ago contained
a population of nine thousand
souls, professing the more rigid doctrines
of the <em>Douchobertzi</em>. Kaponstin
had been a sub-officer in the imperial
guard, was of studious habits, and of
the most scrupulous exactness in the
performance of his military duties.
His fanaticism came on him all of a
sudden.  One day, in the guardroom,
he stood up among the soldiers,
whom he had previously won over to
his doctrine, and summoned them to
fall down on the ground and adore
him, as he was the <em>Christ</em>—a command
which most of them instantly obeyed.
Kaponstin was degraded from his
rank, and committed to prison; but
on its being found that he was totally
unfitted for a military life, he was released,
and he at once resumed his
preachings. Kaponstin taught that
the Divine soul of Christ had, from
the beginning of the world, dwelt in
a succession of men, who alone were,
each in turn, the true heads of the
church. As mankind degenerated,
and became unworthy of the sacred
deposit, false popes usurped the dignity
and attributes of the Son of God.
The <em>Douchobertzi</em> were now the sole
and true guardians of the treasure
which especially dwelt in him as
the incarnation of the sect. His followers
believed him at his word,
and fell down and worshipped him.
Kaponstin again attracted the attention
of the authorities, and was again
thrown into prison. A large sum of
money, the produce of the contributions
of hundreds of thousands, was
offered as a bribe to the gaoler—and
when did a Russian functionary refuse
a bribe? He regained his liberty, fled
to the forests, was once more hunted
down, but baffled the vengeance of his
pursuers. He shut himself up in a
cavern in the remote districts of the
Taurida, and under the vigilant eye of
his followers, by none of whom his
secret was revealed, passed there the
remaining years of his life, preaching,
believed, and adored. His retreat the
police did not or would not discover;
when he died is known only to a few.
The mantle of Kaponstin was assumed
by his son, who proved himself unworthy
of wearing it. At the age of
fifteen he was received by his father’s
disciples as his true successor, and the
Christ of the <em>Douchobertzi</em>. At his
installation the grand council of the
sect assembled, and the first resolution
adopted was that ten concubines
should be allotted to their youthful
prophet, Hilarion Kaponstin. He did
not merit the reverence paid him, nor
did he inherit a particle of the intellect
or the courage of his father. From
the day of his installation he gave
himself up to the most debasing sensuality.
The father had instituted a
council, composed of forty members,
twelve of whom represented the
apostles. This council took advantage
of the incapacity of its boy-prophet,
and from being merely a legislative,
assumed the functions of an
executive power, which it exercised
most tyrannically. It soon became
the scourge of the community.
As the members of the council were
only divine by reflection, it was no
crime to shake off its usurped authority,
and the sect rose in rebellion. The
tyrants were seized, tried in secret
conclave, and sentence of death pronounced
against them, for usurpation
and cruelty. A lonely isle near
the mouth of the Malotschua was
selected for the execution, and there
they suffered the last penalty. There,
also, during the two years which
followed that event, more than five
hundred members of the sect were put
to death, suspected of having revealed
the secrets of its orgies. They were
drowned in the stream, or perished by
the halter or the knife; at all events,
they disappeared, and were never
more heard of. These doings, even
in that remote district, could not long
be kept secret. The police bestirred
themselves; the isle where so many
deeds of murder had taken place was
visited, and closely searched; and
numerous bodies that had apparently
been buried alive, carcasses strangled
or hacked to pieces, and mutilated
limbs, were found in abundance. Some
years were spent in the inquiry, and
the issue was, that at the close of
1839 the government ordered the
complete expulsion of the <em>Douchobertzi</em>
of the Malotschua. Many withered
and perished amid the snows of the
Caucasus. Their nominal chief, Hilarion
Kaponstin, died in 1841, at Achaltisk,
in Georgia, leaving behind him
two infants, in whom the <em>Douchobertzi</em>
still hope to see their Christ revived.</p>

<p class='c010'>Those we have sketched are but a
few specimens of the long catalogue of
sects who disavow the dogmas of the
Church of St Petersburg, and denounce
its Holy Synod. There are
others that work in obscurity, but
with perseverance, and gradually, but
steadily, sap its foundations. Most of
those doctrines lead to the complete
disruption of all moral bonds, and the
dissolution of society; and sensuality,
plunder, and cruelty seem to pervade
the gloomy reveries in which the
Russian peasant indulges. We have
reason to believe that the stirring
of that dangerous spirit which aims
at the overthrow of all authority,
has given serious uneasiness to the
Russian government; and that the
conspiracies which have more than
once been found to exist in the army,
are traceable to that dark and stern
fanaticism! Education, of course, is
the remedy for the evil. In Russia,
however, the maxim of Bacon is reversed,
and there <em>ignorance</em>, not
<em>knowledge</em>, is believed to be power.
If education once teach the Russian
serf to regard the Czar as less than the
Deity, how long would that despotism
endure?</p>

<p class='c010'>Such, then, is the “orthodoxy”
which the Czar would extend over
southern Europe, whose doctrines and
whose unity he would impose on
Greece; and such the religious protectorate
with which the Greek Christians,
the subjects of the Porte, are
menaced. Those pretensions have no
foundation, no justification, in civil or
religious law; they are not based on
the laws of any civilised community.
The orthodox Church of Russia is but
the erring offspring of the Church of
Constantinople; and she is branded
on the forehead by that Church with
schism. It was from the Church of
Constantinople that, down to the
fifteenth century, she received her
patriarchs, who never advanced pretensions
to equality with the Byzantine
pontiffs. What they might have
attained to, it is now useless to inquire,
for the link which bound that
Church to her parent was, as we have
shown, severed for ever by Peter
the Great. By the same right as the
Czar, the sovereign of France might
claim a protectorate over the Catholics
of Belgium or Northern Germany;
or call upon the Autocrat himself to
render an account of the Poles, or
others of his Catholic subjects. Russia
has no claim to eminence in piety,
in learning, in antiquity, in superior
morality, or in extent of privilege.
Her Church has been for years forced
to maintain a separate struggle against
sects more or less hostile to her Synod,
and to her temporal authority. Each
prelate, each dignitary of her establishment,
is, with respect to the Czar,
precisely what the meanest serf is to
his lord, and the mass of her priests
are sunk in ignorance. The question
of the Holy Shrines is invariably the
mask assumed by Russia to cover
her designs in the East. The right on
which the nations of the West claim
to protect the Cross from the Infidel
dates from the Crusades. Among the
hosts which the enthusiasm and eloquence
of the Hermit sent forth to do
battle with the Mussulman, and to liberate
from the cruel yoke of the misbelievers
the land which witnessed the
mystery of the Redemption, the name
of Russia is not to be found. These
barbarians had then their necks bowed
under the rule of the Tartars; they
were then crowding to the tents of the
Khans, kissing the hoofs of their masters’
horses, or presenting, as slaves,
the draught of mares’ milk, too happy
if permitted to lick from the dust the
drops that fell from the bowl.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps we ought to offer an apology
for the length of this paper. But
we were desirous of showing, <em>first</em>,
that the homogeneity of the Russian
and Eastern Churches, on which the
Czar lays his strongest claim to the
protectorate he demands, has no
foundation in fact, and that the
Christian communities on which he
would impose his protection deny the
orthodoxy of his faith, and regard him
as the usurper of spiritual power;
<em>second</em>, that the doctrines of the
Synod of St Petersburg are denounced
by Russians themselves, and the establishment
opposed by a formidable
sectarianism, and that that Church is
itself rather in a condition to require
protection against its internal enemies
than to afford it to others; <em>third</em>,
that even supposing the Russian and
Eastern Churches to be identical, the
protectorate in question would, in consequence
of the temporal privileges
preserved by the Patriarch of Constantinople,
as already noticed, be the
positive introduction of a dangerous
foreign influence in the domestic administration
of the Ottoman empire,
and that the Sultan would thereby
become the vassal of the Czar;
<em>fourth</em>, that as there are numerous
Christian subjects of the Sublime
Porte who do not belong to the Greek
communion, their protector, where
protection is needed, cannot be the
Czar; and, <em>fifth</em>, that the semi-independent
Moldo-Wallachians also disavow
the doctrines of the Russian
Church, and reject her protection.</p>

<p class='c010'>We do not pretend to speak with
enthusiasm of the Ottomans, but it
must be admitted, that what has occurred
since the commencement of the
present quarrel is not to their disadvantage.
Unlike the Czar, the
Sultan has made no appeal to the
mere fanaticism of his people, nor
has he attempted to arouse the fierceness
of religious hatred against the
<em>Giaour</em>, which he might have done. His
appeal has been to their feeling of nationality—such
an appeal as every government
would make in similar circumstances.
Nor are the events which
have taken place on the Danube likely
to inspire the world with contempt for
Ottoman valour and patriotism. If
left alone to struggle with their powerful
adversary, the Turks must succumb;
but in the present campaign
they have, at all events, proved themselves
to be good soldiers.</p>

<p class='c010'>The momentous question of a general
war is, at the moment we write
these lines, trembling in the balance;
and the decision is with Austria. But
whatever be the phase into which the
great Eastern question is about to
enter, we have one decided opinion
on the policy of Russia. It is thus
explained, not by a hostile or a
foreign writer, but by a Russian historian,
the eloquent Karamsin, in the
following brief sentences: “The object
and the character of our military
policy has invariably been, to seek to
be at peace with everybody, and <em>to
make conquests without war</em>; always
keeping ourselves on the defensive,
placing no faith in the friendship of
those whose interests do not accord
with our own, and losing no opportunity
of injuring them, without <em>ostensibly</em>
breaking our treaties with them.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Nature, it would seem, has fortunately
provided against the simultaneous
development of kindred genius
and intellect amongst human families.
Such, at least, is the general rule, and
it is a beneficent one. For if a sudden
frenzy were to seize the whole clans
of Brown, or Smith, or Campbell, or
Thomson—were the divine afflatus
breathed at once upon the host, more
numerous than that of Sennacherib,
of the inheritors of the above names,
undoubtedly such a confusion would
ensue as has not been witnessed since
the day of the downfall of Babel.
Passing over three of these great
divisions of the human race, as located
in the British Islands, let us confine
our illustration simply to the sons of
Diarmid. Without estimating the
number of Campbells who are scattered
over the face of the earth, we
have reason to believe that in Argyllshire
alone there are fifty thousand of
that name. Out of each fifty, at least
twenty are Colins. If, then, a poetical
epidemic, only half as contagious as
the measles, were to visit our western
county, we should behold the spectacle
of a thousand Colin Campbells rushing
frantically, and with a far cry
towards Lochow, and simultaneously
twangling on the clairshach. Fame,
in the form of a Druidess, might announce,
from the summit of Kilchurn
Castle, the name of the one competitor
who was entitled to the wreath; but
twice five hundred Colins would press
forward at the call, and the question
of poetic superiority could only be
decided by the dirk. Fortunately, as
we have already observed, nature
provides against such a contingency.
Glancing over the cosmopolitan directory,
she usually takes care that no
two living bards shall bear precisely
the same appellation; and if, sometimes,
she seems to permit an unusual
monopoly of some kind of talent in
the same family or sept, we almost
never find that the baptismal appellations
correspond. Thus, in the days
of James I., there were no less than
three poetical Fletchers—John, the
dramatist; Phineas, the author of the
<cite>Purple Island</cite>; and Giles, the brother
of Phineas. Also there were two
Beaumonts—Francis, the ally of the
greater Fletcher, and Sir John, his
brother. In our own time, the poetic
mantle seems to have fallen extensively
on the shoulders of the Tennysons.
Besides Prince Alfred, whom we all
honour and admire, and to whom more
than three-fourths of our young versifiers
pay homage by slavishly imitating
his style, there was Charles, whose
volume, published about the same
time as the firstling of his brother,
was deemed by competent judges to
exhibit remarkable promise; and
within the last few months, another
Tennyson—Frederick—has bounded
like a grasshopper into the ring, and
is now piping away as clearly as any
cicala. And here, side by side, amidst
the mass of minstrelsy which cumbers
our table, lie two volumes, on the
title-page of each of which is inscribed
the creditable name of Arnold.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have not for a considerable
time held much communing with the
rising race of poets, and we shall at
once proceed to state the reason why.
Even as thousands of astronomers are
nightly sweeping the heavens with
their telescopes, in the hope of discovering
some new star or wandering
comet, so of late years have shoals of
small critics been watching for the
advent of some grand poetical genius.
These gentlemen, who could not, if
their lives depended on it, elaborate a
single stanza, have a kind of insane
idea that they may win immortal fame
by being the first to perceive and hail
the appearance of the coming bard.
Accordingly, scarce a week elapses
without a shout being raised at the
birth of a thin octavo. “Apollodorus,
or the Seraph of Gehenna, a Dramatic
Mystery, by John Tunks,” appears;
and we are straightway told,
on the authority of Mr Guffaw, the
celebrated critic, that:—“It is a work
more colossal in its mould than the
undefined structures of the now mouldering
Persepolis. Tunks may not,
like Byron, possess the hypochondriacal
brilliancy of a blasted firework, or
pour forth his floods of radiant spume
with the intensity of an artificial volcano.
He does not pretend to the
spontaneous combustion of our young
friend Gander Rednag (who, by the
way, has omitted to send us his last
volume), though we almost think that
he possesses a diviner share of the
poet’s ennobling lunacy. He does not
dive so sheer as the author of <cite>Festus</cite>
into the bosom of far unintelligibility,
plummet-deep beyond the range of
comprehension, or the shuddering
gaze of the immortals. He may not
be endowed with the naked eagle-eye
of Gideon Stoupie, the bard of Kirriemuir,
whose works we last week
noticed, and whose grand alcoholic
enthusiasm shouts ha, ha, to the
mutchkin, as loudly as the call of the
trumpet that summons Behemoth
from his lair. He may not, like the
young Mactavish, to whose rising
talent we have also borne testimony,
be able to swathe his real meaning in
the Titanic obscurity of the parti-coloured
Ossianic mysticism. He may
not, like Shakespeare, &#38;c. &#38;c.” And
then, having occupied many columns
in telling us whom Mr Tunks does
<em>not</em> resemble, the gifted Guffaw concludes
by an assurance that Tunks is
Tunks, and that his genius is at this
moment flaring over the universe,
like the meteor-standard of the
Andes!</p>

<p class='c010'>Desirous, from the bottom of our
heart, to do all proper justice to Tunks,
we lay down this furious eulogium,
and turn to the volume. We find, as
we had anticipated, that poor Tunks
is quite guiltless of having written a
single line of what can, by any stretch
of conscience, be denominated poetry—that
the passages which Guffaw
describes as being so ineffably grand,
are either sheer nonsense or exaggerated
conceits—and that a very excellent
young man, who might have
gained a competency by following his
paternal trade, is in imminent peril of
being rendered an idiot for life by the
folly of an unscrupulous scribbler.
Would it be right, under those circumstances,
to tell Tunks our mind,
and explain to him the vanity of his
ways? If we were to do so, the poor
lad would probably not believe us;
for he has drunk to the dregs the
poisoned chalice of Guffaw, and is
ready, like another Homer, to beg for
bread and make minstrelsy through
innumerable cities. If we cannot hope
to reclaim him, it would be useless
cruelty to hurt his feelings, especially
as Tunks is doing no harm to any
one beyond himself. So we regard
him much as one regards a butterfly
towards the close of autumn, with the
wish that the season of his enjoyment
might be prolonged, but with the
certainty that the long nights and
frosty evenings are drawing nigh.
Little, indeed, do the tribe of the
Guffaws care for the mischief they are
doing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Or take another case. Let us suppose
the appearance on the literary
stage of a young man really endowed
with poetic sensibility—one whose
powers are yet little developed, but
who certainly gives promise, conditionally
on proper culture, of attaining
decided eminence. Before we know
anything about him, he is somehow or
other committed to the grasp of the
Guffaws. They do not praise—they
idolise him. All the instances of
youthful genius are dragged forth to
be debased at his feet. He is told, in
as many words, that Pope was a
goose, Chatterton a charlatan, Kirke
White a weakling, and Keats a driveller,
compared with him,—at any rate,
that the early effusions of those poets
are not fit to be spoken of in the same
breath with what he has written at a
similar age. There are no bounds to
the credulity of a poet of one-and-twenty.
He accepts the laudation of
those sons of Issachar as gospel, and,
consequently, is rather surprised that
a louder blast has not been blown
through the trumpet of fame. His
eulogists are so far from admitting
that he has any faults, that they hold
him up as a pattern, thereby exciting
his vanity to such an extent that an
honest exposition of his faults would
appear to him a gross and malignant
outrage. It is really very difficult to
know what to do in such cases. On
the one hand, it is a pity, without an
effort, to allow a likely lad to be flyblown
and spoiled by the buzzing
blue-bottles of literature; on the other,
it is impossible to avoid seeing that
the mischief has been so far done, that
any remedy likely to be effectual
must cause serious pain. To tie up a
Guffaw to the stake, and to inflict upon
him condign punishment—a resolution
which we intend to carry into effect
some fine morning—would be far less
painful to us than the task or duty of
wounding the sensitiveness of a youth
who may possibly be destined to be a
poet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Setting, for the present, the Guffaws,
or literary Choctaws, aside, we have
a word to say to a very different class
of critics, or rather commentators;
and we desire to do this in the utmost
spirit of kindness. Whether
Aristotle, who could no more have
perpetrated a poem than have performed
the leger-de-main of the
Wizard of the North, was justified in
writing his “Poetics,” we cannot
exactly say. More than one of his
treatises upon subjects with which he
hardly could have been practically
conversant, are still quoted in the
schools; but we suspect that his authority—paramount,
almost, during the
middle ages, because there were then
no other guides, and because he found
his way into Western Europe chiefly
through the medium of the Moors—is
fast waning, and in matters of taste
ought not now to be implicitly received.
Aristotle, however, was a
great man, far greater than Dr Johnson.
The latter compiled a Dictionary;
Aristotle, by his own efforts,
aspired to make, and did make, a sort
of Encyclopædia. But he composed
several of his treatises, not because he
conceived that he was the person best
qualified to be the exponent of the
subject, but because no one really
qualified had attempted before him to
expound it. We have seen, and
perused with real sorrow, a recent
treatise upon “Poetics,” which we
cannot do otherwise, conscientiously,
than condemn. The author is no
doubt entitled to praise on account of
his metaphysical ability, which we devoutly
trust he may be able to turn to
some useful purpose; but as to poetry,
its forms, development, machinery,
or application, he is really as ignorant
as a horse. It is perfectly frightful
to see the calmness with which one
of these young students of metaphysics
sits down to explain the principles
of poetry, and the self-satisfied air
with which he enunciates the results
of his wonderful discoveries. Far be
it from us, when “our young men
dream dreams,” to rouse them rudely
from their slumber; but we hold it
good service to give them a friendly
shake when we observe them writhing
under the pressure of Ephialtes.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is one thing to descant upon
poetry, and another to compose it.
After long meditation on the subject,
we have arrived at the conclusion
that very little benefit indeed is to be
derived from the perusal of treatises,
and that the only proper studies for a
young poet are the book of nature,
and the works of the greatest masters.
To that opinion, we are glad to observe,
one of our Arnolds seriously
inclines. Matthew—whom we shall
take up first, because he is an old acquaintance—has
written an elaborate
preface, in which he complains of the
bewildering tone of the criticism of the
present day. He remarks with perfect
justice, that the ceaseless babbling
about art has done an incalculable
deal of harm, by drawing the attention
of young composers from the
study and contemplation of their
subjects, and leading them to squander
their powers upon isolated passages.
There is much truth in the
observations contained in the following
extract, albeit it is in direct opposition
to the daily practice of the
Guffaws:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“We can hardly, at the present day,
understand what Menander meant when
he told a man who inquired as to the
progress of his comedy, that he had
finished it, not having yet written a single
line, because he had constructed the action
of it in his mind. A modern critic
would have assured him that the merit
of his piece depended on the brilliant
things which arose under his pen as he
went along. We have poems which seem
to exist merely for the sake of single lines
and passages; not for the sake of producing
any total impression. We have
critics who seem to direct their attention
merely to detached expressions,—to the
language about the action, not to the action
itself. I verily think that the majority
of them do not in their hearts
believe that there is such a thing as a
total-impression to be derived from a poem
at all, or to be demanded from a poet;
they think the term a commonplace of
metaphysical criticism. They will permit
the poet to select any action he pleases,
and to suffer that action to go as it will,
provided he gratifies them with occasional
bursts of fine writing, and with a shower
of isolated thoughts and images. That
is, they permit him to leave their poetical
sense ungratified, provided that he gratifies
their rhetorical sense and their
curiosity. Of his neglecting to gratify
these there is little danger; he
needs rather to be warned against the
danger of attempting to gratify these
alone; he needs rather to be perpetually
reminded to prefer his action to everything
else; so to treat this, as to permit
its inherent excellencies to develop themselves,
without interruption from the intrusion
of his personal peculiarities—most
fortunate when he most entirely succeeds
in effacing himself, and in enabling a
noble action to subsist as it did in nature.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It would be well for the literature
of the age if sound criticism of this description
were more common. Mr
Arnold is undoubtedly correct in holding
that the first duty of the poet,
after selecting his subject, is to take
pains to fashion it symmetrically, and
that any kind of ornament which tends
to divert the attention from the subject
is positively injurious to the poem.
This view, however, is a great deal
too refined for the comprehension of
the Guffaws. They show you a hideous
misshapen image, with diamonds
for eyes, rubies stuck into the nostrils,
and pearls inserted in place of teeth,
and ask you to admire it! Admire
what? Not the image certainly, for
anything more clumsy and absurd it
is impossible to imagine: if it is meant
that we are to admire the jewels, we
are ready to do so, as soon as they
are properly disposed, and made the
ornaments of a stately figure. The
necklace which would beseem the
bosom of Juno, and send lustre even
to the queen of the immortals, cannot
give anything but additional hideousness
to the wrinkled folds of an
Erichtho. Mr Arnold, who has inherited
his father’s admiration for
ancient literature, makes out the best
case we remember to have seen, in
vindication of the Greek drama. It
is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“For what reason was the Greek tragic
poet confined to so limited a range of
subjects? Because there are so few actions
which unite in themselves, in the highest
degree, the conditions of excellence; and
it was not thought that on any but an
excellent subject could an excellent poem
be constructed. A few actions, therefore,
eminently adapted for tragedy, maintained
almost exclusive possession of the Greek
tragic stage; their significance appeared
inexhaustible; they were as permanent
problems, perpetually offered to the genius
of every fresh poet. This too is the reason
of what appears to us moderns a certain
baldness of expression in Greek tragedy;
of the triviality with which we
often reproach the remarks of the chorus,
where it takes place in the dialogue; that
the action itself, the situation of Orestes,
or Merope, or Alcmæon, was to stand the
central point of interest, unforgotten, absorbing,
principal; that no accessories
were for a moment to distract the spectator’s
attention from this; that the tone
of the parts was to be perpetually kept
down, in order not to impair the grandiose
effect of the whole. The terrible
old mythic story on which the drama was
founded, stood, before he entered the
theatre, traced in its bare outlines upon
the spectator’s mind; it stood in his memory
as a group of statuary, faintly seen,
at the end of a long and dark vista: then
came the Poet, embodying outlines, developing
situations, not a word wasted,
not a sentiment capriciously thrown in:
stroke upon stroke the drama proceeded;
the light deepened upon the group; more
and more it revealed itself to the rivetted
gaze of the spectator; until at last, when
the final words were spoken, it stood before
him in broad sunlight, a model of
immortal beauty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This is indeed criticism worth listening
to, and the style of it is not
less admirable than the matter. We
do not, however, entirely go along
with Mr Arnold in his decided preference
for the antique drama. We
never arise from the study of Greek
tragedy without the impression that
it is deficient in richness and flexibility.
This, we think, is to be attributed
in a great measure to its form,
which is not natural; the members of
the chorus being neither altogether
actors, nor altogether disinterested
spectators. They are interlopers between
the audience and the actors,
and detract from the interest of the
latter by requiring and receiving explanation.
That at least is our feeling
after the perusal of Greek tragedy,
but it by no means follows that the
same impression was produced on the
minds of a Greek audience. We agree
with Professor Blackie that the grand
works of the Attic three are to be regarded
rather as operas than as tragedies,
according to our modern
acceptance of the term—that they
were framed purposely for musical
accompaniment and effect—and that,
failing these, it is impossible for us to
form an adequate estimate of their
power in exciting sympathy or awakening
emotion. “The man,” says the
translator of Æschylus, “must certainly
be strangely blinded by early
classical prepossessions, if he fails to
feel that, as a whole, a Greek tragedy,
when set against the English composition
of the same name, is exceedingly
narrow in its conception, meagre
in its furniture, monotonous in its
character, unskilful in its execution,
and not seldom feeble in its effect.”
Most true—and for this reason, that
the writer of English tragedy seeks
no other vehicle of thought or idea
than language; so that, except for
scenic display, his play will give as
much pleasure to, and produce nearly
the same effect upon the mind, if read
silently in the closet, as if brought
upon the stage. It is not necessary,
in order to appreciate Shakespeare,
that we should have seen his dramas
represented in the pomp and magnificence
of the theatre. Whereas the
Greek artist had to deal with the more
complex material of words and music.
Take away the latter, and you frustrate
half his design; because he did
not mean the words of the chorus to
be studied as poems—he meant them
to be heard with the full accompaniment
of music. Those who are in the
habit of frequenting the modern opera
will readily understand our position.
What can be finer than <em>Norma</em>, as
represented on the stage, when Grisi
or Caradori assumes the part of the
prophetess, imprecates vengeance on
the perfidious Pollio, and implores the
forgiveness of the father? Higher
tragedy than that can hardly be conceived—the
effect upon the audience
of the combined music and action is
as powerful as though they had been
listening to the greatest masterpiece
of Shakespeare. But take the libretto
of <em>Norma</em>—divest yourself of the
musical association—study it in the
closet—and we answer for it that no
exercise of imagination on your part
will enable you to endure it. And
why is this? Simply because it was
constructed as an opera, and because,
by withdrawing the music, you destroy
more than half the charm.</p>

<p class='c010'>In dramatic compositions, where
language alone can be employed as
the vehicle of thought or sentiment, it
is absolutely necessary that the expression
should be bolder, the style
more vivid, and the range of illustration
larger than is requisite in the
other kind where music is brought in
aid of language, or rather where language
is employed to assist the force
of music. It seems therefore preposterous
and contrary to reason, to expect
that we should take as much
delight or derive as high intellectual
gratification from the bare perusal of
a Greek skeleton play, as must have
been felt by an Attic audience who
witnessed its representation as a gorgeous
national opera. It is even a
greater artistical mistake to suppose
that we should copy it implicitly.
Alfieri indeed did so; but it is impossible
to read one of his plays without
experiencing a most chilly sensation.
We entirely concur with what Mr
Arnold has said regarding the importance
of subject, symmetry, and design;
but we differ from him as to
the propriety of adhering to the nakedness
of the Greeks. Let him compare—so
far as that can be done with
due allowance for the difference being
narrative and dramatic poetry—the
style of his early favourite Homer
with that of Sophocles, and we think
he will understand our meaning.</p>

<p class='c010'>We confess to have been so much
pleased with Mr Matthew Arnold’s
preface, that we turned to his poetical
performances with no slight degree
of expectation. As we have already
hinted, he is an old acquaintance, for
we reviewed him in the Magazine
some four or five years ago, when he
appeared in the suspicious character
of a <cite>Strayed Reveller</cite>. We then pointed
out what we thought to be his faults,
warned him as strongly as we could
against his imitative tendencies, and,
we hope, did justice to the genius
which he evidently possessed and
occasionally exhibited. Certainly we
did not indulge in ecstasies; but we
believed him capable of producing,
through culture and study, something
greatly superior to his early attempts,
and we did not hesitate to say so.
Since then, we are given to understand
that he has published another
volume of poems, which it was not
our fortune to see; and the present
is, with some additions, a collection
of those poems which he considers
to be his best, and which were contained
in his earlier volumes. It is a
hopeful sign of Mr M. Arnold that he
is amenable to criticism. More than
one of the poems which we noticed
as absolutely bad, are omitted from
the present collection; and therefore
we are entitled to believe that, on
mature consideration, he has assented
to the propriety of our judgment.
This is a good feature; for poets generally
seem possessed with a tenfold
share of stubbornness, and, like mothers,
who always lavish their affections
upon the most rickety of their
offspring, are prompt to defend their
worst effusions with almost superhuman
pertinacity. It is because we
feel a decided interest in Mr Arnold’s
ultimate success that we again approach
his poetry. We cannot conscientiously
congratulate him on a
present triumph—we cannot even say
that he has improved upon his earliest
effort; for the “Forsaken Merman,”
which we noticed years ago, in terms
of high commendation, is still the one
gem of his collection; but we think
that he may improve, and must improve,
if he will only abandon all
imitation, whether ancient or modern—identify
himself with his situation—trust
to natural impulse—and give
art-theories to the winds. What he
has to do is to follow the example of
Menander, as quoted by himself. Let
him, by all manner of means, be deliberate
in the formation of his plan—let
him fix what he is going to do,
before he does anything—but let him
not forget (what we fear he now forgets
or does not know), that, in execution,
the artist must beat on his own
anvil, sweat at his own fire, and ply
at his own forge. The poem of a
master should bear as distinct and
unmistakable marks of the hand that
produced it, as a picture of Titian or
Velasquez, a statue of Phidias, an
altar-rail of Quentin Matsys, or a
goblet of Benvenuto Cellini. Heaven
only knows how many thousands of
imitators have followed in the wake
of these and other great original
artists; but who cares for the imitations?
No one, unless they are so
good that they can be palmed off on
purchasers under cover of the mighty
names. Admit them to be imitations,
and the merest tyro will hesitate to
bid for them. It does seem to us
that men of letters are slower than
any other description of artists in
perceiving the baneful effects of imitation.
They do not appear to see
this obvious truth, that, unless they
can transcend their model, they are
deliberately courting an inferior place.
If they can transcend it, then of course
they have won the day, but it must
be by departing from, not by adhering
to, the peculiarities of the model.</p>

<p class='c010'>In so far as Mr Matthew Arnold is
concerned, we do not intend these
remarks to be applicable to his Greek
choric imitations. We spoke of these
before, and are willing to take them
as classical experiments. Goethe, in
his old age, was rather fond of this
kind of amusement; and it came
gracefully from the octogenarian, who,
having won his fame as a Teuton,
might in his latter days be allowed
to indulge in any Hellenic exercitations.
And as old age is privileged,
so is extreme youth. The young
student, with his head and imagination
full of Sophocles and classical
theories, even though he may push
the latter beyond the verge of extravagance,
is always an interesting object
to the more experienced man of
letters. Enthusiasm is never to be
despised. It is the sign of a high and
ardent spirit, and ought not to be
met with the drenching operation of
the bucket. But Mr M. Arnold is
now considerably past his teens. He
is before the public for the third time,
and he still parades these Greek imitations,
as if he were confident of
their worth and power as English
poems. So be it. We have nothing
in regard to them to add to what we
said before, except that a much higher
artist than Mr M. Arnold must appear,
before the British public will be
convinced that such hobbling and unrhymed
versification ought to supersede
our own beautifully intoned and
indigenous system of prosody.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of the new poems contained in this
collection, the most ambitious is entitled
“Sohrab and Rustum, an Episode.”
We like episodes, because
they have the advantage of being short,
and, moreover, if well constructed, are
as symmetrical as poems of greater
pretension. The story is a simple
one, and yet contains in itself the
elements of power. Sohrab, the son
of the great Persian hero Rustum, by
a princess of Koordistan, has never
seen his father, but, like Telemachus,
is in search of him. Being with the
Tartar army during a campaign
against the Persians, he conceives
the idea of challenging the bravest
champion of that host to single combat,
in the hope that, if he is victor,
Rustum may hear of and acknowledge
him. If slain—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Old man, the dead need no one, claim no kin.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The challenge is given; but Sohrab
was already known far and wide
as a handy lad with the scimitar,
and a powerful hurler of the spear;
therefore the Persians, with their
usual want of pluck, were exceedingly
unwilling to encounter him. We
subjoin Mr Arnold’s account of the
panic:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But as a troop of pedlars from Cabool</div>
      <div class='line'>Cross underneath the Indian Caucasus,</div>
      <div class='line'>That vast sky-neighbouring mountain of milk snow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Winding so high, that, as they mount, they pass</div>
      <div class='line'>Long flocks of travelling birds dead on the snow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Choked by the air; and scarce can they themselves</div>
      <div class='line'>Slake their parch’d throats with sugar’d mulberries—</div>
      <div class='line'>In single file they move, and stop their breath,</div>
      <div class='line'>For fear they should dislodge the o’erhanging snows—</div>
      <div class='line'>So the pale Persians held their breath with fear.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And to Ferood his brother chiefs come up</div>
      <div class='line'>To counsel: Gudurz and Zoarrah came,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Feraburz, who rul’d the Persian host</div>
      <div class='line'>Second, and was the uncle of the king.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Not one of these fellows with the jaw-breaking
names could muster courage
to come forth, like Goliath, against
the dauntless David of the Tartars.
Gudurz, however, bethinks him that
Rustum had arrived in the camp the
evening before, and of course he was
the very man for the occasion; so he
visits him immediately after breakfast.
All heroes feed, or ought to
feed, voraciously; and judging from
appearances, Rustum was qualified to
compete at a game of knife and fork
with Achilles.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And Gudurz entered Rustum’s tent, and found</div>
      <div class='line'>Rustum: his morning meal was done, but still</div>
      <div class='line'>The table stood beside him, charged with food;</div>
      <div class='line'>A side of roasted sheep, and cakes of bread,</div>
      <div class='line'>And dark-green melons.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Possibly from the effects of repletion,
Rustum for some time refuses
to accept the championship, but is at
last taunted into action and takes the
field, but determines to fight unknown.
We ought to mention here that Rustum,
so far from suspecting his relationship
with Sohrab, is unaware that
he has any son at all. We must draw
on Mr Arnold’s verse for the exordium
to the combat.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Like some young cypress, tall, and dark, and straight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which in a queen’s secluded garden throws</div>
      <div class='line'>Its slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf,</div>
      <div class='line'>By midnight, to a bubbling fountain’s sound—</div>
      <div class='line'>So slender Sohrab seem’d, so softly rear’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>And a deep pity entered Rustum’s soul</div>
      <div class='line'>As he beheld him coming; and he stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>And beckoned to him with his hand, and said:—</div>
      <div class='line'>‘O thou young man, the air of heaven is soft,</div>
      <div class='line'>And warm, and pleasant; but the grave is cold.</div>
      <div class='line'>Heaven’s air is better than the dead cold grave.</div>
      <div class='line'>Behold me: I am vast, and clad in iron,</div>
      <div class='line'>And tried; and I have stood on many a field</div>
      <div class='line'>Of blood, and I have fought with many a foe:</div>
      <div class='line'>Never was that field lost, or that foe saved.</div>
      <div class='line'>O Sohrab, wherefore wilt thou rush on death?</div>
      <div class='line'>Be govern’d: quit the Tartar host, and come</div>
      <div class='line'>To Irun; and be as my son to me,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fight beneath my banner till I die.</div>
      <div class='line'>There are no youths in Irun brave as thou.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“So he spoke mildly: Sohrab heard his voice,</div>
      <div class='line'>The mighty voice of Rustum; and he saw</div>
      <div class='line'>His giant figure planted on the sand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sole, like some single tower, which a chief</div>
      <div class='line'>Has builded on the waste in former years</div>
      <div class='line'>Against the robbers; and he saw that head,</div>
      <div class='line'>Streak’d with its first grey hairs: hope fill’d his soul;</div>
      <div class='line'>And he ran forwards, and embrac’d his knees,</div>
      <div class='line'>And clasp’d his hand within his own and said:—</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Oh, by thy father’s head! by thine own soul!</div>
      <div class='line'>Art thou not Rustum? speak! art thou not he?’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But Rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And turn’d away, and spoke to his own soul:—</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Ah me! I muse what this young fox may mean.</div>
      <div class='line'>False, wily, boastful are these Tartar boys.</div>
      <div class='line'>For if I now confess this thing he asks,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hide it not, but say—<em>Rustum is here</em>—</div>
      <div class='line'>He will not yield indeed, nor quit our foes,</div>
      <div class='line'>But he will find some pretext not to fight,</div>
      <div class='line'>And praise my fame, and proffer courteous gifts—</div>
      <div class='line'>A belt or sword perhaps—and go his way.</div>
      <div class='line'>And on a feast-day in Afrasiab’s hall,</div>
      <div class='line'>In Samarcand, he will arise and cry—</div>
      <div class='line'>“I challenged once, when the two armies camp’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Beside the Oxus, all the Persian lords</div>
      <div class='line'>To cope with me in single fight: but they</div>
      <div class='line'>Shrank; only Rustum dared: then he and I</div>
      <div class='line'>Changed gifts, and went on equal terms away.”</div>
      <div class='line'>So will he speak, perhaps, while men applaud.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then were the chiefs of Irun shamed through me.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And then he turn’d, and sternly spake aloud:—</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Rise! wherefore dost thou vainly question thus</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Rustum? I am here, whom thou hast call’d</div>
      <div class='line'>By challenge forth: make good thy vaunt, or yield.</div>
      <div class='line'>Is it with Rustum only thou wouldst fight?</div>
      <div class='line'>Rash boy, men look on Rustum’s face and flee.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Then follows the combat, Homerically
intermingled with a great deal
of talk between the champions, until
Sohrab falls mortally wounded by his
father’s spear. Then come the explanations,
and Rustum knows that
he has slain his son.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And with a heavy groan, Rustum replied:—</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Oh that its waves were flowing over me!</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh that I saw its grains of yellow silt</div>
      <div class='line'>Roll tumbling on the current o’er my head!’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And with a grave mild voice, Sohrab replied:</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Desire not that, my father; we must live.</div>
      <div class='line'>For some are born to do great deeds, and live,</div>
      <div class='line'>As some are born to be obscured, and die.</div>
      <div class='line'>Do thou the deeds I die too young to do,</div>
      <div class='line'>And reap a second glory in thine age.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou art my father, and thy gain is mine.</div>
      <div class='line'>But come: thou seest this great host of men</div>
      <div class='line'>Which follow me; I pray thee, slay not these:</div>
      <div class='line'>Let me entreat for them: what have they done?</div>
      <div class='line'>They followed me, my hope, my fame, my star.</div>
      <div class='line'>Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace.</div>
      <div class='line'>But me thou must bear hence, not send with them,</div>
      <div class='line'>But carry me with thee to Seistan,</div>
      <div class='line'>And place me on a bed, and mourn for me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou, and the snow-hair’d Zal, and all thy friends.</div>
      <div class='line'>And thou must lay me in that lovely earth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And heap a stately mound above my bones,</div>
      <div class='line'>And plant a far-seen pillar over all:</div>
      <div class='line'>That so the passing horsemen on the waste</div>
      <div class='line'>May see my tomb a great way off, and say—</div>
      <div class='line'><em>Sohrab, the mighty Rustum’s son, lies there,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Whom his great father did in ignorance kill</em>—</div>
      <div class='line'>And I be not forgotten in my grave.’</div>
      <div class='line'>And with a mournful voice Rustum replied:—</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Fear not; as thou hast said, Sohrab, my son,</div>
      <div class='line'>So shall it be: for I will burn my tents,</div>
      <div class='line'>And quit the host, and bear thee hence with me,</div>
      <div class='line'>And carry thee away to Seistan,</div>
      <div class='line'>And place thee on a bed, and mourn for thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>With the snow-headed Zal, and all my friends.</div>
      <div class='line'>And I will lay thee in that lovely earth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And heap a stately mound above thy bones,</div>
      <div class='line'>And plant a far-seen pillar over all;</div>
      <div class='line'>And men shall not forget thee in thy grave.</div>
      <div class='line'>And I will spare thy host: yea, let them go:</div>
      <div class='line'>Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace.</div>
      <div class='line'>What should I do with slaying any more?’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Real poetry, we are sorry to say, is
now so scarce among us, that we cannot
afford to dismiss any promising
aspirant with a sneer. From the foregoing
extracts it will be seen that Mr
M. Arnold, in opposition to the tenets
of that school of bardlings so copiously
beslavered by Guffaw, has adopted,
in this poem, a simple and even severe
method of expression. He is now
writing after Homer—not, indeed,
slavishly, but on the Homeric principle;
and the question now arises,
whether or not he has succeeded. Our
opinion is that this poem is highly
creditable as an attempt in the right
direction—that it is infinitely superior
to the turgid trash with which we have
been, of late years, inundated—but
that it has not merit enough to confer
lasting distinction on the author. Mr
Arnold, we are aware, has been told
the reverse; and as the sugared cup
is always more palatable than that
which contains an ingredient of bitter,
he may possibly be inclined to prefer
sweet panegyric to sincere though
wholesome criticism. But we are not
writing for him alone; we are attending
to the poetical reputation of the
age. In this composition, as it appears
to us, Mr Arnold again suffers through
imitation. He is writing, with deliberate
intention, Homerically—that is,
he has been keeping Homer in his eye,
instead of rivetting it on his subject.
Now this is a great mistake. The
peculiar manner of a poet depends
upon the age in which he lives.
There is an enormous gap in world-history
between “the blind old
man of Scio’s rocky isle,” and Mr
Matthew Arnold, who dates from
“Fox How, Ambleside,” <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1853;
and it is a sheer impossibility that
the two can naturally express themselves
alike. What was nature in the
one, is affectation in the other. Homer
expressed himself simply, because he
was addressing a simple audience;
and also because his hearty, noble,
and grand organisation made him
superior to rhetorical conceits or affectation.
Arnold also expresses himself
simply; but he does so, not from
native impulse or inspiration, but because
he is aware of Homer’s charm.
But he frustrates his own intention
by deliberately copying Homer, and
making his readers painfully aware
of it. A true, or at all events a very
accomplished poet, would not have
committed this error. Let any man,
of really cultivated taste in poetry,
read the “Hyperion” of Keats, and
the “Morte D’Arthur” of Tennyson—both
of them splendid poems, and
distinguished by severe simplicity of
language—and then compare them
with this effusion of Mr Arnold. We
cannot for one moment doubt the
verdict. Keats and Tennyson saw
the principle, but they kept themselves
away from imitation, gave
their genius full play, and achieved
magnificent results. Mr Arnold, recognising
the principle, cannot divert
his eye from the model, adopts the
peculiarities of that, and fails. In
fact, imitation is his curse. We said
so more than four years ago, and we
now repeat it. So strong is his tendency
that way, that he cannot, within
the limits of a composition of moderate
length, confine himself to the
imitation of a single renowned poet,
but makes patchwork by copying the
peculiarities, even though they are
acknowledged blemishes, of another.
Thus we find, nearly at the commencement
of the poem which we
are now discussing, the following
passage:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The sun, by this, had risen, and clear’d the fog</div>
      <div class='line'>From the broad Oxus and the glittering sands:</div>
      <div class='line'>And from their tents the Tartar horsemen filed</div>
      <div class='line'>Into the open plain; so Haman bade;</div>
      <div class='line'>Haman, who next to Peran Wisa ruled</div>
      <div class='line'>The host, and still was in his lusty prime.</div>
      <div class='line'>From their black tents long files of horse they stream’d:</div>
      <div class='line'>As when, some grey November morn, the files,</div>
      <div class='line'>In marching order spread, of long-neck’d cranes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stream over Casbin, and the southern slopes</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Elburz, from the Aralian estuaries,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or some from Caspian reed-bed, southward bound</div>
      <div class='line'>For the warm Persian sea-board: so they stream’d.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Tartars of the Oxus, the king’s guard,</div>
      <div class='line'>First, with black sheepskin caps, and with long spears;</div>
      <div class='line'>Large men, large steeds; who from Bokhara come</div>
      <div class='line'>And Khiva, and ferment the milk of mares.</div>
      <div class='line'>Next the more temperate Toorkmans of the south,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Tukas, and the lances of Salore,</div>
      <div class='line'>And those from Attruck and the Caspian sands;</div>
      <div class='line'>Light men, and on light steeds, who only drink</div>
      <div class='line'>The acrid milk of camels and their wells.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The description—or catalogue—is
twice as long as the foregoing extract,
but we cannot afford to multiply
quotations. The student of Milton
will readily recognise the source
of this inspiration, and will regret
that those very passages, which every
sound judge (if he be not an arrant
pedant or a schoolmaster) would
wish to be excised from the pages of
the “Paradise Lost,” should have
been selected for imitation by a young
modern poet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Further, Mr Arnold errs in being
unnecessarily minute. Here again he
may plead the Homeric example;
but we reply, as before, that Arnold
is not Homer. That style of description,
which Delille happily characterises
as “peindre les ongles,” is not
only tedious but puerile, and sometimes
has a ludicrous effect. Take,
for example, the following detailed
account of the toilet of an old Tartar
gentleman:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“So said he, and dropp’d Sohrab’s hand, and left</div>
      <div class='line'>His bed, and the warm rugs whereon he lay,</div>
      <div class='line'>And o’er his chilly limbs his woollen coat</div>
      <div class='line'>He pass’d, and tied his sandals on his feet,</div>
      <div class='line'>And threw a white cloak round him, and he took</div>
      <div class='line'>In his right hand a ruler’s staff, no sword;</div>
      <div class='line'>And on his head he placed his sheepskin cap,</div>
      <div class='line'>Black, glossy, curl’d, the fleece of Kara-Kul;</div>
      <div class='line'>And raised the curtain of his tent, and call’d</div>
      <div class='line'>His herald to his side, and went abroad.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Now, supposing that Mr Arnold
had to describe the uprising of a
modern, would he consider it necessary
to favour us with a description
of the emergence from the blankets,
the deposition of the nightcap, the
wrestle into the nether integuments,
the shaving-jug, the razor, and all
the rest of it? We beg to assure him
that this passage, so far from being
vigorous, is pure slip-slop; and we
are convinced that, on reflection, he
will admit the justice of the stricture.
For example; how infinitely more
terse and satisfactory is the one line
which Shakespeare puts into the
mouth of poor Ophelia—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Then up he rose, and donn’d his clothes!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>What the mischief do we care for the
texture of the stockings, or the peculiar
method of investiture? Is it
necessary to enter into details regarding
the boots, and to specify whether
they were Wellingtons or Bluchers?
That there are, in this episode, some
fine, and one or two noble passages,
we are very glad to acknowledge, but
it is by no means perfect as a whole.
Indeed, even if the bulk of it had been
faultless, the termination would have
spoiled it as a poem; for Mr Arnold
has been induced, through some extraordinary
hallucination, to destroy
the effect of the catastrophe, by superadding
a needless piece of description.
We sincerely regret this; because the
catastrophe, when it does come (and
it ought to have arrived sooner) is
very fine; and no artist could have
desired a better termination than the
picture of Rustum watching by his
dead son—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And night came down over the solemn waste,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair,</div>
      <div class='line'>And darken’d all; and a cold fog, with night,</div>
      <div class='line'>Crept from the Oxus. Soon a hum arose,</div>
      <div class='line'>As of a great assembly loosed, and fires</div>
      <div class='line'>Began to twinkle through the fog: for now</div>
      <div class='line'>Both armies moved to camp, and took their meal:</div>
      <div class='line'>The Persians took it on the open sands</div>
      <div class='line'>Southward; the Tartars by the river marge,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Rustum and his son were left alone.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Here the poem ought to have ended;
but Mr Arnold wishes to try his
hand at that very ancient and hackneyed
subject, the description of the
course of a river; and, the Oxus being
conveniently near, he embarks on
a voyage for the Arab Sea.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But the majestic river floated on,</div>
      <div class='line'>Out of the mist and hum of that low land,</div>
      <div class='line'>Into the frosty starlight, and there moved,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rejoicing, through the hush’d Chorasmian waste,</div>
      <div class='line'>Under the solitary moon: he flow’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Right for the Polar star, past Orgunjè,</div>
      <div class='line'>Brimming, and bright, and huge: there sands begin</div>
      <div class='line'>To hem his watery march, and dam his streams,</div>
      <div class='line'>And split his currents; that for many a league</div>
      <div class='line'>The shorn and parcell’d Oxus strains along</div>
      <div class='line'>Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles—</div>
      <div class='line'>Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had</div>
      <div class='line'>In his high mountain cradle in Pamere,</div>
      <div class='line'>A foil’d circuitous wanderer:—till at last</div>
      <div class='line'>The long’d-for dash of waves is heard, and wide</div>
      <div class='line'>His luminous home of waters opens, bright</div>
      <div class='line'>And tranquil, from whose floor the new-bath’d stars</div>
      <div class='line'>Emerge, and shine upon the Arab Sea.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Not at all bad as a piece of versification,
but utterly to be condemned
in the place where it is introduced.</p>

<p class='c010'>In spite of one or two beautiful
passages—the best being the description
of the children at play in the
third part—we cannot enthusiastically
admire the poem of “Tristram and
Iseult.” It is sickly, feverish, and
withal terribly disjointed—affording
no trace of that symmetry of design,
the lack of which in modern poetry
Mr Arnold has very justly deplored.
Neither can we say much for the
“Church of Brou,” in which, by the
way, Mr Arnold has attempted an
elaborate description of a painted window,
very dull of tint, indeed, when
we compare it with the gorgeous masterpiece
in “The Eve of St Agnes.”
On the whole, we are disappointed
with this volume, because we really
think that Mr M. Arnold might have
done much better. That he has the
power is quite evident; that many of
the poetical views he enunciates are
sound, we have already acknowledged;
but, somehow or other, he
neither exerts the power continuously,
nor adheres in practice to his views.
We have a strong impression that he
composes too coldly and phlegmatically,
and without allowing the proper
scope to his imagination. That
is always a bad method. The inspiration
of the poet is not by any means
a mere figure of speech; it must be
realised, if great effects are to be produced.
Verses—ay, and good verses
too—may be written to almost any
extent, without the composer experiencing
anything like a thrill of emotion;
but verses so produced are not
of the nature of true poetry. Grand
harmonies suggest and develop themselves
only when the mind is in an exalted
state; and at such times the
poet cares nothing for the rules of art.
If he stops to consider these, he instantaneously
loses the inspiration.</p>

<p class='c010'>We cannot, as yet, congratulate Mr
M. Arnold on high success; but we
augur well of him for the future, and
shall be delighted to pay him a more
decided and satisfactory tribute whenever
he will allow us to do so. Come
we now to the second Arnold—Edwin,
of University College, Oxford.</p>

<p class='c010'>Judging from external evidence, we
should say that Edwin is some years
younger than Matthew, and he is fortunately,
as yet, altogether free from
poetical theories. Song comes to him
as naturally as it does to the bird on
the bough. He cannot help expressing
his thick-thronging and always
graceful fancies in verse; and he frequently
does so with the true minstrel
spirit. That he should be occasionally
a little extravagant is to be expected.
All very young poets are so,
and we like them the better for it; for
why should they affect the solemn airs
and sententious pomposity of their
seniors? Edwin Arnold is just now in
the very parterre of poesy—culling
flowers with a liberal hand, and binding
them into a nosegay fit for the acceptance
of his lady-love. Our pen
would prove faithless to our fingers
should we attempt to disentangle that
pretty posy, which early genius lays at
the feet of beauty. Why should we review
his poems, after the manner of
the cold critics, carping at what is
enthusiastic, and triumphing over errors,
from which older brethren of the
lyre are by no means exempt? If he
chooses, in imitation of “Burleigh
Hall,” to renew the story of the Falcon-Feast,
long since told by Boccaccio,
and from him dramatised by
Barry Cornwall, why should we point
to faults which, in a year or so, he
will discover of his own accord?
Never again, we are certain, will he,
in a love story, libel his hero and his
heroine as he has done in four lines of
that ballad—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“So for one who loved him never</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Slew he what had loved him well:</div>
      <div class='line'>Giannetta, silent ever,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Feasted till the sunlight fell;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>—thereby implying that the owner of
the falcon was a brute, and his mistress
a deliberate <i><span lang="fr">gourmande</span></i>, gloating
over the trail! The story, even as
told by the Florentine, has always
seemed to us hideously unnatural.
The man who could sacrifice, in cold
blood, a dumb creature that loved
him, would not hesitate, under temptation,
to lay a sacrilegious hand on
the weazand of his father; and we
pray Mr Edwin Arnold to consider
what kind of sympathy we should feel
for Ulysses, if his first act, on his return
to Ithaca, had been to drive his
falchion into the heart of old Argus,
who, for so many years, had been lying
neglected at the gate, pining for
his master’s return. Let us rather
give a specimen or so of the better
style of our youthful poet. We begin
with the first poem.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh! was there ever tale of human love</div>
      <div class='line'>Which was not also tale of human tears?</div>
      <div class='line'>Died not sweet Desdemona? Sorrowed not</div>
      <div class='line'>Fair, patient Imogene? and she whose name</div>
      <div class='line'>Lives among lovers, Sappho silver-voiced,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was not the wailing of her passionate lyre</div>
      <div class='line'>Ended for ever in the dull, deaf sea?</div>
      <div class='line'>Must it be thus? Oh! must the cup that holds</div>
      <div class='line'>The sweetest vintage of the vine of life</div>
      <div class='line'>Taste bitter at the dregs? Is there no story,</div>
      <div class='line'>No legend, no love-passage, which shall veil</div>
      <div class='line'>Even as the bow which God hath bent in heaven</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er the sad waste of mortal histories,</div>
      <div class='line'>Promising respite to the rain of tears?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A very pretty commencement to a
pretty poem; the subject of which,
however, must be considered as rather
ticklish. It is curious that Edwin, as
well as Matthew, has tried his hand
at the painted window, which we
wish he had not done, as the plagiary
from Keats is evident:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“They sleep: the spangled night is melting off,</div>
      <div class='line'>And still they sleep: the holy moon looks in,</div>
      <div class='line'>In at the painted window-panes, and flings</div>
      <div class='line'>Ruby, blue, purple, emerald, amethyst,</div>
      <div class='line'>Crystal and orange colours on their limbs;</div>
      <div class='line'><em>And round her face a glory of white light,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>As one that sins not</em>; on the tapestries</div>
      <div class='line'>Gold lights are flashing like the wings of angels,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bringing these two hearts to be single-hearted.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>O Edwin! what could tempt you
to charge your pallet with so many
colours? Don’t you see how ill they
assort together, giving the impression
of a mashed rainbow?—and how
dreadfully out of place are the flashing
gold lights! They should be
“lying,” Edwin, not “flashing;”
for the holy moon is looking in, and
all within the chamber should be repose.
Pray you observe the exquisite
toning of Keats in that passage with
which you are already familiar, but
the extreme beauty of which you do
not yet thoroughly comprehend.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Full on this casement shone the wintry moon,</div>
      <div class='line'>And threw warm gules on Madeline’s fair breast,</div>
      <div class='line'>As down she knelt for Heaven’s grace and boon;</div>
      <div class='line'>Rose-bloom fell on her hands, together prest,</div>
      <div class='line'>And on her silver cross soft amethyst,</div>
      <div class='line'>And on her hair a glory, like a saint:</div>
      <div class='line'>She seemed a splendid angel, newly drest,</div>
      <div class='line'>Save wings, for heaven.—”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Keats gives the colours in which an
angel should be painted—yours, Mr
Edwin, are too tawdry even for the
coat of Harlequin.</p>

<p class='c010'>So many of these poems come under
the general title of “Occasional,” that
we have some difficulty in finding a
proper one for extract. Our favourite,
on the whole, is “Quentin Matsys,”
and from it we select a specimen.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“She was a painter’s daughter,—bold for love</div>
      <div class='line'>He told his earnest suit, and prayed her hand</div>
      <div class='line'>In words that his full heart made eloquence.</div>
      <div class='line'>Silent the father heard; there as he sate</div>
      <div class='line'>In jewelled silks, and velvets furbelow’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>With works of mighty masters on the wall,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all his art’s appliances about him,</div>
      <div class='line'>A stern smile curled his pale patrician lip,</div>
      <div class='line'>And cold and slow the cruel sentence came:</div>
      <div class='line'>‘A painter’s daughter may not wed a smith;</div>
      <div class='line'>Paint me like this and these, and thou shalt have her.’</div>
      <div class='line'>Died then his love? Listen! The maiden wept</div>
      <div class='line'>Such pearly tears, that in his bursting heart</div>
      <div class='line'>Grew up strange hopes. Alas! to few is given</div>
      <div class='line'>The magic skill that burns in life-like hues,</div>
      <div class='line'>A speaking lip, an eye that beams and loves,</div>
      <div class='line'>A moving majesty like nature’s own,</div>
      <div class='line'>Save that this may not die: it is a gift</div>
      <div class='line'>Higher and holier than a common man</div>
      <div class='line'>May dare to reach at; oh! by what right, then,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dared he to dream of it? by what right! Love’s!—</div>
      <div class='line'>The love that lifts a peasant to a king,</div>
      <div class='line'>The love that knows no doubting! Well he knew—</div>
      <div class='line'>Too well for his fond hopes—that brawny arms</div>
      <div class='line'>Guide not the pencil, and that smithy strokes</div>
      <div class='line'>Fix not the fancies of a painter’s mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>But still for that. To gaze into the eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>That sparkled all for him was inspiration</div>
      <div class='line'>Better than painter’s best: long days and nights</div>
      <div class='line'>He strove as only lovers strive; at last</div>
      <div class='line'>The passport to the haven of his hopes</div>
      <div class='line'>Came in a touch, as if some angel hand</div>
      <div class='line'>Had dipt his brush in life; and as the form</div>
      <div class='line'>His fancy pictured, slowly—slowly grew,</div>
      <div class='line'>And woke into broad being, then at last</div>
      <div class='line'>He knew that he had won his golden prize—</div>
      <div class='line'>That she was his for ever.</div>
      <div class='line in20'>Antwerp’s bells</div>
      <div class='line'>Rung out right merrily one sunny day;</div>
      <div class='line'>Blue kirtles, and bright hose, and brighter faces,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rhenish and sack, dancing and songs were there,</div>
      <div class='line'>Feasting and music, and mad revelry,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all to keep the wedding:—cavaliers</div>
      <div class='line'>And highborn ladies stood to see them pass,</div>
      <div class='line'>He, Quentin Matsys, and his blooming bride!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Well then, after having given these
extracts, we may be asked whether we
think that Mr Edwin Arnold is really
and truly a poet? Look, our dear sir,
we beseech you, at that splendid gamecock—how
glossy in his plumage, how
quick in his eye, how massive in his
neck, and how powerful in his limbs!
There he walks, proud as the sultan
at the head of his seraglio, the pride
of his master’s heart, the terror of
every recreant dunghill within a circle
of a couple of miles. Some few
months ago he was a mere chicken,
whom you might have devoured with
parsley-sauce without experiencing a
pang of remorse. Before that he lay
in an egg-shell. Now, had you looked
either on the egg or on the chicken,
you could not have stated with propriety
that either was a gamecock—and
yet there undeniably goes the
finest ginger-pile in the parish. So is
it with Mr Edwin Arnold. He may
not be entitled yet to the high and
sacred name of a poet—for he is still
exercising himself in verse, and has
not attained the possession of a distinguishing
style of his own; but he
shows excellent symptoms of breeding,
and we doubt not will, in due
time, advance a valid claim to the
laurels. This, moreover, is to be said
in his favour, that he is not treading
in the footsteps of the “intense”
school, and that he always writes intelligibly—a
virtue which we observe
a good many modern poets hold utterly
in derision. Let him go on in
his vocation, cultivating his taste,
improving his judgment, observing
nature, and eschewing gaudy ornament—and
he may hope to win a
name which shall be reverenced, when
those of the utterers of fustian and
balderdash, dear to the heart of Guffaw,
are either wholly forgotten, or
remembered only with ridicule.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>COUNT SIGISMUND’S WILL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The theatrical season in Paris, now
at its height, has not yet been marked
by the production of any particularly
successful pieces. At about this time
last year, the clever comedy of <cite>Lady
Tartuffe</cite> afforded agreeable occupation
to the critics, and abundant amusement
to the town. At the Gymnase,
the <cite><span lang="fr">Fils de Famille</span></cite>, of which two versions
have since been produced upon
the London stage, and <cite>Philiberte</cite>, a
sparkling three-act comedy in verse,
full of wit, but rather <cite>Régence</cite> in its
tone and style, nightly filled the
house with select and gratified audiences.
<cite><span lang="fr">L’Honneur et l’Argent</span></cite>, M.
Ponsard’s respectable and proper,
but, in our opinion, wearisome play,
had a triumphant run at the Odeon;
whilst, at the Vaudeville, the <cite>Lady
with the Camelias</cite>, who, objectionable
though she was in some respects, was
certainly, as far as talent went, immeasurably
superior to her various
imitators and successors, drew all
Paris to her seductive boudoir. This
winter no play of decided merit and
importance has been produced at any
theatre. In more than one instance,
attempts have been made to proclaim
the success of a piece immense, when
in reality it was most moderate; and,
at the Gymnase, <cite>Diane de Lys</cite> has
really had a considerable run; but
this has been owing to extraneous
circumstances, and to the excellence
of the acting, much more than to any
intrinsic merits of the play, which derived
a sort of scandalous interest
from a generally-credited report that
the author, Alexander Dumas the
younger, had merely dramatised an
adventure of his own—altering, however,
the catastrophe; for the play
closes with the death of the lover,
shot by the offended husband. Rumour
went so far as to point to a
foreign lady of rank as the original
of the <em>Duchess Diana</em>, and the playwright
was blamed for his indiscretion.
Whether there were grounds
for such censure, or whether the tale
was a mere ingenious invention, industriously
circulated by the author’s
friends to give a spurious popularity
to a rather amusing but very worthless
piece, it is hard to decide—the
one case being quite as probable as
the other. The Gymnase, however,
boasts of its <em>Diana</em> as a signal triumph—which
she may be to its treasury, although
in other respects she does the
theatre no great credit, beyond displaying
an excellent cast and admirable
acting. That agreeable theatre
needs something to console it for the
loss of its most valuable and accomplished
comedian, Bressant, summoned
by the higher powers from the
scene of his numerous triumphs to the
classic boards of the <em>Française</em>. There
he had the good taste to make his
first appearance in a play of Molière’s
in preference to the less sterling class
of comedy with which he is more familiar;
and, both by his acting, and
by the enthusiastic greeting he met
from a crowded house, he at once
proved himself a valuable accession
to the talent and popularity of the
first French theatre. That establishment
just now has greater need of
good new plays than of good new
actors. It is unfortunate in its authors,
and the drama droops under
the imperial régime. Alexander Dumas—whose
outrageous vanity and
fanfaronades, daily displayed in the
columns of the new journal, the <cite><span lang="fr">Mousquetaire</span></cite>,
which he owns and edits,
have lately made him the laughingstock
of Paris,—after writing two
five-act historical plays in about as
many days each, and having them
both accepted by the committee, but
prohibited before performance—probably
because the authorities did not
think the most important theatre in
France a fit stage for such mountebank
feats of rapid writing—has been
fain to console himself (supposing his
egregious self-conceit not to have set
him above all need of consolation) by
the cordial reception of a one-act
comedy called <cite>Romulus</cite>, which has
both humour and character. He has
boasted of this little success almost
as much as of the merits of his two
great failures, the interdicted plays;
has published the piece (the idea of
which is derived from a passage in
one of Auguste La Fontaine’s tales)
in the <em>feuilleton</em> of his paper, where
he also printed monstrous stories
about his having written it in some
wonderfully short space of time. But
this clever silly man has made himself
such a reputation as a Munchausen
that none now believe him; and,
moreover, it is very well known in
Paris that the piece in question was
planned, and in great part written,
by an accomplished French actor,
much esteemed in England, to whose
cultivated taste and extensive reading
some of the best dramatists of
the day have on various occasions
been indebted for advice and assistance,
which they have not all been
so slow as Mr Dumas to acknowledge.</p>

<p class='c010'>The expectations of many persons,
conversant with the relative merits of
the principal living writers for the
French stage, were lately raised high
by the announcement of a five-act
comedy from the united pens of two
of the most successful of these, Messrs
Emile Augier and Jules Sandeau.
Both of these gentlemen have distinguished
themselves as dramatists,
although M. Sandeau is perhaps best
known as the author of some very
clever and agreeable novels. Indeed,
since the regretted decease of Charles
de Bernard, few have been more
successful in that branch of literature.
His style is that in which modern
French writers have best succeeded—the
<i><span lang="fr">roman de mœurs</span></i>, or novel of
society, whose attraction and interest
depend rather upon accurate delineation
and delicate satire of the habits,
follies, and foibles of the time, than
in startling situations and complicated
intrigues. The late Charles de
Bernard, to whose charming talent
we some years ago devoted an article,
and whose collected works have just
received the well-deserved honour
of posthumous republication, was an
adept in the style, and was also one
of the most inventive writers of his
day. Most of his novels and tales
display, in addition to a refined and
extensive knowledge of French society
and character, much ingenuity
of plot and originality of incident.
Of the same school, Jules Sandeau
has more pathos and sentiment, less
originality and wit.  Like that of
most novelists who are also dramatists,
his dialogue is terse, spirited,
and life-like, although less pointed and
sparkling than that of the author of
<cite><span lang="fr">Gerfaut</span></cite>. Occasionally he reminds
us of that clever whimsical writer,
Alphonse Karr, but of Karr in his
happiest moods, when he abjures
triviality, and produces such novels
as <cite>Genevieve</cite> and <cite><span lang="fr">La Famille Alain</span></cite>.
One of the favourite stock-pieces at
the <cite><span lang="fr">Comédie Française</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="fr">Mademoiselle
de la Seiglière</span></cite>, is by Sandeau, founded
on his own novel of the same name.
Another of his tales, <cite><span lang="fr">La Chasse au
Roman</span></cite>, he dramatised conjointly with
Augier, and the piece brought out
the other day, <cite><span lang="fr">La Pierre de Touche</span></cite>—The
Touchstone—is also founded on
a novel by Sandeau, entitled <cite><span lang="fr">Un
Héritage</span></cite>. How is it, many have
asked, that, with an excellent subject—that
of a highly popular romance—to
work upon, M. Sandeau and the
witty and experienced author of
<cite>Gabrielle</cite>, <cite>Philiberte</cite>, and other justly
successful plays, have produced a
comedy which has been more or less
hissed every night of its performance,
and which, instead of awakening the
sympathies or exciting the admiration
of the public, has produced an impression
so manifestly unfavourable,
that the authors deemed it necessary
to publish a letter in explanation and
vindication—a letter the publishers
of the play have reproduced in the
form of a preface? Before replying
to this question, or sketching the
plot of the play, we will give a slight
outline of the novel on which it is
founded. Our readers will hardly
have forgotten another of M. Sandeau’s
novels, <cite><span lang="fr">Sacs et Parchemins</span></cite>, of
which we some time ago gave an account.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
Those who have read, with
the amused interest it could hardly
fail to excite, M. Sandeau’s account
of the vaulting ambition of the retired
draper Levrault, and of the
desperate and ludicrous expedients of
the ruined Viscount de Montflanquin,
in his French Wolf’s Crag, will not be
unwilling to follow the same writer
upon German ground, to the ancient
castle of Hildesheim, and into the
humble abode of Franz Müller, the
musician of Munich. We will briefly
glance at the spirited and characteristic
opening chapters of <i><span lang="fr">Un Héritage</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a great day for Master
Gottlieb Kaufmann, notary in the
little German town of Mühlstadt.
Count Sigismund Hildesheim was
just dead, and his will was to be
opened in presence of his assembled
relatives. Gottlieb, attired in suitable
sables, the silver buckles of his
shoes replaced by others of burnished
steel, fidgetted to and fro between
his study and his office, his
office and his drawing-room, scolding
his clerks, sending away clients,
and watching the clock, whose lazy
hands, he thought, crept more slowly
than usual round the dial. Noon
was the hour fixed for the reading of
the will, and as yet it was but nine.
It was an anxious morning for the
worthy notary. The very pig-tail
that dangled from his nape quivered
with impatience. The cause of his
excitement was his doubt whether
the heir to the castle and fine estate
of Hildesheim would continue to employ
him. There were other notaries
at Mühlstadt, and all were eager to
secure so rich a client. Master
Gottlieb had spared no pains to retain
the lucrative employment. His
drawing-room chairs, stripped of the
cases that usually protected them
from the pranks of the flies, were
drawn round a table spread with an
old scarlet velvet cover; near this
table, another chair, elevated upon a
temporary platform, seemed to preside
over the absent assembly. From
time to time, Master Gottlieb seated
himself in it, studied his gestures
and attitude, and contemplated his
reflection in a glass, endeavouring to
combine regret and obsequiousness in
the expression of his habitually jovial
physiognomy. His face was to do
double duty—to deplore the departed
and offer his services to the survivors.
Further to propitiate the clients he
desired to secure, Master Gottlieb—himself
of a convivial turn, fond of a
cool bottle and a merry catch—had
prepared, in an adjoining room, an
elegant collation. On a cloth of
dazzling whiteness were temptingly
displayed cold meats, fragrant fruits,
and antique flasks, dim with venerable
dust. The notary had spared
nothing worthily  to honour the memory
and regale the heirs of the departed
Count.</p>

<p class='c010'>Count Sigismund Hildesheim had
passed, almost from his youth upwards,
for an oddity, an original,
slightly crazed, and only just sane
enough to be intrusted with the guidance
of himself and his affairs. In
reality he was none of those things,
but a misfortune in early life, acting
upon a singularly sensitive and impressionable
nature, had decided his
whole destiny. As a youth, at the
university of Heidelberg, he shunned
the society of the students, and, of an
evening, instead of devoting himself
to beer, tobacco, roaring songs and
political theories, he loved to walk
out and watch the sunset from the
summit of the beautiful hills that enclose
the valley of the Neckar. Returning
home, on a May night, from
one of these solitary rambles, his attention
was arrested, as he passed
through the outskirts of the town, by
a fresh and melodious voice, proceeding
from a window decked and entwined
with flowers. The song was
one of those wild and plaintive ditties,
often of great antiquity, heard in remote
mountain districts, seldom written,
but orally transmitted from generation
to generation. Surprised and
charmed, Sigismund paused and listened;
then he cast a curious glance
into the room. A young girl was
seated at a piano, and by the light of
a lamp he distinguished her to be of
great beauty. Thenceforward, every
evening, on his return from his walks,
the pensive student lingered at that
window. He was seldom disappointed;
most evenings the young
girl was at her piano; and the song
that at first had fascinated him was
evidently her favourite. At last—how
this came about it is immaterial to
inquire—instead of pausing at the
window, Sigismund went in at the
door, and became a constant visitor
to Michaële and her mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>The dwelling of the widow and her
child was humble, but elegant in its
poverty. War, which had robbed
them of a husband and father, had
left them but a scanty pension for
their support. Sigismund was as
much attracted by the mother’s kind
and graceful manners as he had been
enchanted by the daughter’s bright
eyes and sweet voice. He had lost
his own mother when an infant; his
father’s harsh and haughty character
had repelled his affection. He found
a home, congenial to his tastes and
sympathies, in the secluded cottage
in Heidelberg’s suburbs, and there he
and Michaële formed plans of future
happiness undisturbed by fear of obstacles
to their union. But Michaële’s
mother, who at first partook their
hopes, could not repress forebodings
of evil when she remembered that
Sigismund was the heir of an ancient
and wealthy family. Her fears proved
too well founded. When Sigismund,
on quitting the university, spoke to
his father of his projects, he encountered
an insurmountable opposition,
and was compelled to postpone them.
As often as he could escape from Hildesheim
he hurried to Heidelberg, to
pass a few days of mingled grief and
joy. Michaële never complained;
she had always smiles and loving
words to welcome Sigismund, but in
his absence and in secret she pined
away. At last his father died. A
week after his funeral the young
count was at Heidelberg. It was
too late. Michaële was given up by
the physicians; three days afterwards
she breathed her last. More
than once, during those three days of
cruel anguish, the dying girl made
Sigismund play the melody that had
been the origin of their acquaintance,
and which they both passionately
loved. Often, in happier times, they
had sung it together, with joy and
gratitude in their hearts. It was an
air that Michaële had learned when
a child, in the mountains of the Tyrol.
It had fixed itself indelibly in her
memory, and when she died, in Sigismund’s
arms, the sweet melody was
hovering on her lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is something rather German
than French in the strain of the early
chapters of <cite><span lang="fr">Un Héritage</span></cite>, but they are
a mere prologue to the book, and are
unheeded by the dramatist. After
the death of his betrothed, Count
Sigismund abandoned himself to the
most passionate and despairing grief.
He remained at Heidelberg with Michaële’s
mother, who would not quit
the spot where she had dwelt with
her daughter. She did not long survive
her bereavement. Sigismund
followed her to the grave, and returned
to Hildesheim, where he lived
in complete retirement, avoiding intercourse
with his neighbours. He
would not be consoled, and lived alone
with his sorrow. When this became
calmer, he opened his piano and
would have played the Tyrolese air
he and his departed love had so often
repeated. But in vain did he rack
his memory and try every note of the
instrument. The melody had fled,
and would not return. It had departed
with the soul of her from whom
he had learned it. His long paroxysm
of grief had utterly driven it from
his recollection.</p>

<p class='c010'>What does M. Sandeau now, but
send his melancholy hero forth, a pilgrim
over hill and dale, in quest of
the lost melody so inextricably intertwined
with the memory of her he
had so tenderly and deeply loved.
After innumerable efforts to seize the
fugitive sounds, after bursts of impatience,
anger, almost of frenzy, the
enthusiastic Sigismund departed, wandering
in search of an old song. The
idea is fantastical; it may be deemed
far-fetched; but it certainly is not
unpoetical.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He set out for the Tyrol; on the
summit of the mountains, in the depths
of the valleys, he listened to the songs
of the shepherds: no voice repeated
the air Michaële sung. After traversing
Switzerland and Italy he returned
to Germany, and his gentle,
touching monomania then assumed a
new form. He travelled on foot, like
a poor student, listening to every
fresh young voice that met his ear as
he passed through the villages; in
cities, on the public squares, when he
saw a crowd gathered round a band
of itinerant singers, he joined it, and
stirred not from the place until the
<em>alfresco</em> minstrels had exhausted their
musical store. Whilst thus persisting
in the pursuit of this Tyrolese air,
which fled before him as did Ithaca
from Ulysses, it will easily be understood
that he paid little attention to
the management of his estate. Before
commencing his travels, which
had lasted several years, he had installed
in his castle two old cousins of
his mother, Hedwige and Ulrica von
Stolzenfels.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hereabouts M. Sandeau shelves sentiment
and the pathetic, and strikes
into a vein akin to satire, in which, as
he showed us in <em>Sacs et Parchemins</em>,
and some others of his books, he is by
no means less happy. The two old
Stolzenfels are a capital sketch. In
the whole course of their lives, prolonged
to a period it would be ungallant
to guess at, they had had but one
affection—for a scamp of a nephew,
who had ruined them, but whom they
still idolised, although hopeless of his
conversion to better courses. For
this handsome, reckless officer, whose
innumerable follies were redeemed, in
their partial eyes, by his good looks
and prepossessing manners, they had
emptied their purses, sold their diamonds,
and left themselves with an
income barely sufficient for their support.
They would not have given a
copper to a beggar; for Captain
Frederick they would have stripped
themselves of their last dollar, and
have deemed themselves more than
repaid by a visit from him in his fulldress
of captain of hussars. When
Sigismund offered them apartments in
his castle, they gladly accepted them,
at first merely as a comfortable home
free of cost; but when they observed
his absence of mind and his total neglect
of his affairs, they formed other
projects. By nature and habit haughty
and sour to everybody but their beloved
hussar, they forced themselves
to be gentle and humble with Sigismund.
Under pretence of watching
over his interests, they gradually assumed
the whole management of his
house, and soon it might have been
supposed that he was the guest and
that they were his hostesses. When
he set out upon his rambles, Frederick,
who was in garrison in a neighbouring
town, installed himself at the
castle and disposed of everything as
though it had been his patrimony,
keeping horses, dogs, and huntsmen
continually on their legs. The servants,
accustomed to obey the two old
ladies, and seeing that they obeyed
their nephew, obeyed him likewise.
Meanwhile Hedwige and Ulrica built
castles in the air for their darling; or,
it should rather be said, they grasped
in imagination the one already built
on the broad domain of Hildesheim.
Sigismund, they were convinced,
could not live long, leading the
strange, wandering, unhappy life he
did. Why should he not leave part of
his property to Frederick? Why not
all? How could it be better bestowed?
The hussar, to do him justice, entered
into none of their schemes. He drank
Sigismund’s wine, thinned his preserves,
knocked up his horses, and
cared for little besides. When Sigismund
came home for a few days, the
captain made no change in his habits,
and the count, for his part, in no way
interfered with them.</p>

<p class='c010'>To the infinite consternation of the
old maids, there one day arrived at
the castle a distant relative of Sigismund’s
father, of whom they had
heard nothing for many years, and
whom they sincerely trusted had departed
for a better world. Had a
thunderbolt dropped into their aprons
they could hardly have been more
thunderstruck. Major Bildmann, who
had always been rather a loose character,
had just lost his last ducat at
the gaming-table. In this extremity,
Dorothy, his wife, could think of nothing
better than to have recourse to
Count Sigismund. She was careful
not to speak to him of her husband’s
irregularities, and concocted a little
romance about faithless trustees and
insolvent bankers, which Sigismund
implicitly believed. He was touched
by the tale of her misfortunes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother’s two cousins,” he
said, after listening in silence, “occupy
the right wing of the castle;
come and install yourself with the
major in the left wing. There will
still be plenty of room for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Dorothy took him at his word. A
week afterwards she returned with
Major Bildmann, and with little Isaac,
an abominable brat whom she had forgotten
to mention. This mattered
not. Sigismund had again quitted
the castle in pursuit of his chimera.</p>

<p class='c010'>The consternation of a pair of magpies,
disturbed in the plucking of a
pigeon by the sudden swoop of a leash
of sparrow-hawks, may give some idea
of the feelings of Ulrica and Hedwige
at this intrusion upon their territory.
There was deadly hatred between the
right wing and the left. When Sigismund
returned home he did not observe
this. The two maiden ladies
certainly insinuated that the Bildmanns
were no better than they
should be; and the Bildmanns scrupled
not to declare that the Stolzenfels
were no great things; but Sigismund,
whilst they spoke, was thinking of his
Tyrolese air, and when they paused,
he thanked them for having made his
house the asylum of every domestic
virtue.</p>

<p class='c010'>Leaving the inmates of Hildesheim
to their dissensions and illusions, and
passing over a few chapters, we seek
a contrast in an humble dwelling in
Bavaria’s art-loving capital. It is
the abode of Franz Müller, the musician,
Edith his wife, and Spiegel
their friend. Franz and Spiegel had
been brought up together, and had
passed the flower of their youth in
poverty, working and hoping. Franz
studied music, Spiegel was passionately
fond of painting; art and friendship
scared discouragement from their
doors. For the space of three years
they wandered on foot, knapsack on
shoulder and staff in hand, through
Germany and the Tyrol, stopping
wherever the beauty of the country
tempted them, and purveying, each in
his own manner, for the wants of
the community. Sometimes Spiegel
painted a few portraits, at others
Müller gave lessons in singing or
on the piano; or when they arrived
in a town on the eve of a great festival,
he offered to play the church
organ at the next day’s solemnity.
Art and liberty was their motto. In
the course of their wandering existence
they visited the most beautiful valleys,
the most picturesque mountains,
opulent cities, splendid picture galleries,
and amassed a treasure of reminiscences
for future fireside conversation.
They resolved never to marry,
lest domestic cares should interfere
with their enthusiastic pursuit of art.
Spiegel kept his word, but Franz, in a
little Tyrolese town, saw and loved
Edith. In vain did the painter draw
an alarming picture of the inconveniences
of matrimony; Franz married,
and thenceforward his friend
deemed him lost to art. It was reserved
for the gentle Edith to convince
Spiegel of the contrary, and to
tame his somewhat wild and vagabond
nature. When first the newly-married
pair settled at Munich, he
seldom went to see them, but gradually
his visits became more frequent,
until one day, he hardly knew how, he
found himself dwelling under their
roof. In a small house Müller had
taken, he had reserved a bedroom and
studio for his friend. In that modest
abode, situated outside Munich, between
a front court whose walls disappeared
under a drapery of vines and
a little garden crowded with sweet
flowers, happy years flew by. Happy,
but not prosperous. At first Spiegel
had painted pictures, with two or
three of which he was tolerably satisfied,
whilst Franz pronounced them
masterpieces. But they found no
purchasers, and the artist, once so
ambitious, cheerfully resigned his
hopes of fame, and gave drawing lessons.
Müller had composed sonatas
and a symphony; they were as unsuccessful
as Spiegel’s pictures. Vanquished
by the innumerable barriers
that interpose between a poor and
unknown musician and the public,
he, too, submitted to give lessons.
With strict economy they managed
to live, but they laid by nothing;
and Müller was often uneasy
when he thought of the future, and of
the two beautiful children Edith had
born him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One evening, during Spiegel’s absence
from Munich, Franz came home
with a more care-laden brow than
usual, and Edith sat down to the
piano and sang a favourite air, which
had more than once dispelled his momentary
melancholy. The window
was open, and her voice, fresh, pure,
and sonorous, was audible outside the
house. Franz listened, his gloom gradually
softening into reverie, whilst
Herman and Margaret rolled upon
the carpet like kittens at play. That
young woman, whose fair hair fell in
abundant tresses upon her bare shoulders—those
two fine children, joyously
gambolling—the dreamer, whose
hand sustained his thoughtful brow,
composed a charming picture. Suddenly
a stranger appeared, and paused
upon the threshold of the apartment.
He had entered so gently, that
none had heard his steps or now observed
his presence. Edith continued
her song; the intruder listened motionless,
and in apparent ecstasy,
whilst silent tears coursed down his
pale cheeks prematurely furrowed by
pain or sorrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At the stranger’s entreaty, Edith
again and again repeated the song,
which was from her native Tyrol. He
listened with deep emotion. By ordinary
persons he might have been
deemed mad or intrusive, and received
accordingly; but he had had the good
fortune to fall amongst artists. He
passed the evening with them, conversing
as kindly and familiarly as
though they had been old friends.
He found means to draw out Franz,
to make him speak of himself, his
hopes and wishes, his discouragements
and disappointments, his long-cherished
desire for fame, his uneasiness
about the prospects of his children.
Then he asked him to play a piece of
his own composition. Müller played
one of his best sonatas, to which the
stranger listened with the attention of
a judge who will not lightly decide.
The piece played out, he seemed
thoughtful, but said nothing. Poor
Müller, who had expected applause,
consoled himself by thinking that the
eccentric stranger did not understand
music. Instead of praising the fine
composition he had just heard, the unbidden
guest, so kindly welcomed, turned
to Edith and asked her for a copy
of the Tyrolese air. She had never
seen it noted, she said, and doubted
that it ever had been, but Franz
would note it for him. “Most willingly”
was the reply of the good-tempered
artist, who could not repress a
smile at the ill success of his own performance.
In a very few minutes he
had covered a sheet of music-paper
with spots and scratches. Edith graciously
offered it to the stranger. He
seized it with an expression of grateful
joy, glanced hastily over it, pressed
Edith’s hand to his lips, cast an affectionate
glance at the children, and left
the house, as he had entered it, swift
and noiseless as a shadow. He had
not mentioned his name; his kind
hosts had not inquired it; they never
saw him again.</p>

<p class='c010'>On a certain evening, Count Sigismund
returned to Hildesheim Castle,
after one of his long absences, his
countenance lighted up with a mysterious
joy. He spoke to no one, put
aside the servants who crowded round
him, and shut himself up in his apartment.
Soon his piano was heard resounding
under his fingers; he at last
had found the air he so long had
sought. But he did not long enjoy
his victory. He had worn himself out
in pursuit of his mania. One morning,
subsequent to a night during great
part of which the piano had been
continually heard, a servant entered
his room. Sigismund was still seated
at the instrument, one hand resting
on the keys, the other hanging by his
side, his eyes closed, his mouth half
open and smiling. He seemed to sleep,
but he was dead.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were present at the reading
of Count Sigismund von Hildesheim’s
last will and testament the two ladies
Stolzenfels; Major Bildmann, a brokendown
gambler of braggadocio air and
vinous aspect; his wife Dorothy, whose
thin pale lips, and sharp, hooked nose,
gave her no small resemblance to a
bird of prey; and their son Isaac, a horrible
urchin with the profile of a frog
and a head of scrubby white hair,
who, having been ordered by his mother
to behave decorously and look
sorrowful, had given his features a
sulky twist, which considerably augmented
their naturally evil expression.
The opposed camps of Bildmann
and Stolzenfels observed each other
with dislike and distrust. After some
waiting, the gallop of a horse was
heard, and Captain Frederick entered,
whip in hand, and his boots covered
with dust. All who were interested
being thus assembled, Master Gottlieb
broke the seals of the will, which
the count had deposited in his keeping
a month before his death. Divested
of customary formalities and of
preliminary compliments to the family,
the contents of the document were in
substance as follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“My mother’s two cousins, Hedwige
and Ulrica von Stolzenfels, have
at all times shown me the most disinterested
affection. To leave me more
leisure and liberty, they have kindly
taken the management of my house,
and have superintended, with unceasing
zeal and activity, that of my estates.
Frederick, by his youth and
gaiety, has enlivened my dwelling.
To him I am indebted for the only
cheerful moments I for many years
have known. Since their establishment
under my roof, the Stolzenfels
have proved themselves my affectionate
and devoted friends; their
conduct has excited my admiration
and respect, and I desire they should
know that I duly appreciate it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>About this time Hedwige and Ulrica
seemed to grow several inches taller,
and cast a triumphant glance at the
major and Dorothy. As to Frederick,
who, since the reading began, had been
sketching with the point of his horse-whip,
upon the dusty surface of one
of his boots, a likeness of Master
Gottlieb, he gave the last touch to
his work, and commenced upon the
other foot the portrait of Isaac. The
notary continued.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The straightforward frankness and
integrity of Major Bildmann have been,
I here declare, a great consolation to
me, after the deceptions of all kinds that
I experienced in my youth. Mrs Bildmann
has vied with my mother’s cousins
in zeal and devotedness. The
complete absence of all self-interested
views has given a noble and affecting
character to their rivalry. In return
for so much attention and care, they
neither asked nor expected other reward
than my affection. The Bildmanns
have an equal right with the
Stolzenfels to my gratitude.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This became puzzling. A division
of the property was the most natural
inference. Master Gottlieb, dubious
where to seek the rising sun, smiled
benignly on all around. Urged by
the impatient hussar, he resumed the
reading of the will.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At Munich, at No 9, in the street
of the Armourers, lives a young musician,
Franz Müller by name. He
has hitherto contrived, by hard work,
by giving lessons, to support his wife
and children, who tenderly love him.
But Müller is no ordinary musician;
and his genius, to develop itself,
needs but leisure. It is to him, Franz
Müller, residing at Munich, at No 9,
in the street of the Armourers, that I
bequeath my entire property.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It is highly improbable that Master
Gottlieb’s peaceable parlour had ever
before been the scene of such an uproar
as this paragraph of the will occasioned.
The major, Dorothy, and
the two old maids, were for attacking
the document on the ground of the
testator’s insanity; but Frederick, who
could not restrain his laughter at this
eccentric close to an eccentric life,
firmly opposed this, and the bullying
major quailed before his resolute tone
and mien. Franz Müller not being
present, Master Gottlieb no longer
troubled himself to smile on anybody;
but, in an authoritative tone, called
attention to the closing passages of
the will.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Desiring,” the singular document
proceeded, “to insure, after my death,
the welfare of my farmers and servants,
which I feel that I have neglected
too much during my life, I
make it a condition of my bequest
that Franz Müller shall inhabit the
castle for nine months of every year,
and dismiss none of my people. As to
my dear relatives, the Stolzenfels and
the Bildmanns, nothing is to be changed
in their manner of life, and they are to
inhabit the castle as heretofore. Wishing
to insure their independence, it is
my will that Müller shall annually pay
to Ulrica von Stolzenfels one thousand
florins; to Hedwige von Stolzenfels
one thousand florins; to Frederick von
Stolzenfels one thousand florins; to
Major Bildmann two thousand florins,
with reversion, in case of his death,
to Dorothy Bildmann. And that he
should take from his first year’s revenue
a sum of ten thousand florins,
the interest on which is to be allowed
to accumulate until the majority of
Isaac, to whom interest and capital
are then to be paid over.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I give to Frederick von Stolzenfels
the free use of my horses and dogs,
with right of chase over my estates.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I annex to the present will a
Tyrolese air; I desire that it may be
engraved on my tomb and serve as
my epitaph.”</p>

<p class='c010'>After listening to this strange document,
which they declared worthy to
have proceeded from a lunatic asylum,
the ladies had no appetite for Master
Gottlieb’s collation. The major would
gladly have tried the contents of the
cobwebbed bottles, but his wife dragged
him away. Frederick sprang upon
his horse and galloped off, taking
with him upon his boots the portraits
of Isaac and the notary. This functionary,
finding himself deserted by
his guests, called in his head clerk to
help him to drink the health of the
absent legatee.</p>

<p class='c010'>Poor, well-meaning, simple-minded
Count Sigismund would have turned
in his grave had he known all the
mischief and unhappiness, envy, hatred,
and discord, of which his extraordinary
will sowed the seed and gave
the signal. The journey from Munich
to Hildesheim was, for Franz and
Edith, a series of enchanting dreams.
There was but one drawback to their
joy; Spiegel had refused to accompany
them. “No more drudgery, no more
lessons!” Müller had enthusiastically
exclaimed, when a letter from Master
Gottlieb, expressing a hope of the
continuance of the Hildesheim patronage,
and enclosing a copy of the will,
tied with blue ribbons, confirmed
the intimation of good fortune he had
already gleaned from a newspaper
paragraph. “The world belongs to
us; we are kings of the earth! You
shall paint pictures, I will compose
symphonies and operas; we will fill
Germany with our fame.” And he
formed innumerable projects. Their
life thenceforward was to be a fairy
scene, a delightful and perpetual alternation
of refined enjoyments and
artistic toil. Edith partook her husband’s
enthusiasm; Spiegel at first
said nothing, and when he did speak
he gave his friends to understand that
he could not share their prosperity.
He did not like new faces; he preferred
the cottage at Munich to the abode
of a castle, and was proof against all
entreaties. Franz and Edith secretly
resolved to buy the little house as a
gift to their friend. In nine months
they would return to see him, and
perhaps, when they again set out for
Hildesheim, he would consent to accompany
them. Whilst preparing for
departure, and burning useless papers,
Franz laid his hand upon the only
symphony he had found time to write.
Carefully turning over its leaves, with
a disdainful air, he was about to toss
it into the fire, when Spiegel seized
his arm and rescued the composition.</p>

<p class='c010'>Müller had written to the Hildesheim
steward to announce his arrival,
and to forbid all pomp, ceremony, and
public rejoicings on the occasion.
He thought his instructions too literally
carried out, when, upon reaching,
some hours after nightfall, the huge
gates of the castle, all decorated with
stags’ horns, boars’ tusks, and wolves’
heads, he found no servant to receive
him, not a light on the walls or in the
windows, not a torch in the gloomy
avenues of the park. After the postilion
had cracked his whip and wound
his horn for the better part of half an
hour, a glimmering light appeared, a
clanking of keys was heard, and the
gates, slowly opening, disclosed the
sour visage of Wurm the steward, muttering
maledictions on the untimely
visitors. Upon learning who they
were, and at the rather sharp injunction
of Müller, who was exasperated
at the delay, he made what haste he
could to awaken the servants, and
ushered his new master and mistress into
their apartments—immense rooms,
nearly bare of furniture; for, even
during Sigismund’s lifetime, the Stolzenfels
and Bildmann, taking advantage
of his frequent absence of mind,
and from the castle, had stripped that
part of the edifice he had reserved for
his own use. Edith mentally contrasted
the vast gloomy halls with her
snug abode at Munich, and thought
it would have been but kind had the
ladies Stolzenfels and Mrs Bildmann
been there to receive her. But a
night’s rest, a brilliant morning, and
the view of the immense lawns and
rich foliage of the park, effaced the
first unpleasant impression, and, having
previously sent to know when
they could be received, she and her
husband presented themselves in the
apartments of Hedwige and Ulrica.
On their entrance, the two old ladies,
who were seated in the embrasure of
a window, half rose from their seats,
resumed them almost immediately,
and pointed to chairs with a gesture
rather disdainful than polite. Poor
Edith, who, in the innocence of her
heart, had expected smiling countenance
and a friendly welcome, felt
herself frozen by their vinegar aspect.
She turned red, then pale, and knew
not what to say. Müller, without
noticing the ladies’ looks, recited a
little speech he had prepared for the
occasion, expressive of his gratitude
to Count Sigismund for having bequeathed
him, in addition to his estates,
his amiable family. He begged and
insisted that they would change
nothing in their mode of life, &#38;c. &#38;c.
Why should they change anything?
was Ulrica’s sharp and haughty reply;
the count had left them by his will
what he had given them in his lifetime;
they had their rights and asked
nothing beyond them. Hedwige pitched
it in rather a lower key. Their
tastes were very simple. They had
sought neither applause nor luxury at
Hildesheim. Count Sigismund had
always put his carriage and horses at
their disposal. Müller hoped they
would continue to make use of them.
They were lovers of solitude, Hedwige
continued, of silence and meditation.
With Count Sigismund’s consent they
had planted a quickset hedge round
a little corner of the park—not more
than two or three acres. It would
pain them, she confessed, to give up
this little enclosure, whither they repaired
to indulge their evening reveries.
Franz eagerly assured them that none
should disturb them in their retreat.
Having obtained these assurances,
and repelled, with chilling stiffness,
Edith’s warm-hearted advances, the
amiable spinsters relapsed into silence,
which all their visitors’ efforts were
insufficient to induce them to break,
until the upset of a table of old china,
occasioned by the gambols of Herman
and a black cat, effectually roused
them from their assumed apathy.
The Müllers beat a retreat and went
to call on Major Bildmann and his
wife, whom they surprised in the
midst of a domestic squabble—a circumstance
of itself sufficient, had
others been wanting, to secure them
a surly reception. Franz’s mild and
gentle bearing encouraged the major
to assume his most impertinent tone,
whilst his falcon-faced spouse ventured
offensive inuendoes as to the real
motives of Count Sigismund’s will—inuendoes
whose purport was utterly
unsuspected by the pure-hearted Müllers.
Here, too, there was an enclosure
in the case, where the major
cultivated the flowers his dear Dorothy
preferred, and where the infant Isaac
loved to disport himself. As an old
soldier, Major Bildmann added, he
loved the chase, which was the image
of war. The count had allowed him
the range of his preserves. Müller
eagerly confirmed him in all his privileges.
On quitting the Bildmann
wing he found Wurm waiting for him
to pass the servants in review. He
made them an affecting little speech,
by which they seemed very little
affected. Then Wurm named them.
There were Mrs Bildmann’s waitingmaid
and the major’s valet, the servants
of the ladies Stolzenfels, the
cooks of the right and left wings,
Isaac’s nurse, Major Bildmann’s
butler, Captain Frederick’s grooms
and huntsmen, &#38;c. &#38;c. Müller inquired
for his own servants—those
that had been Count Sigismund’s.
They were all before him. The two
wings had swallowed up the body.
Wurm felt secretly surprised at a
musician’s needing servants when the
count had done without them. Müller
dryly informed him that Count
Sigismund’s servants were his, and
that he made him responsible for
their attention to his service. He
said nothing to Edith of this strange
scene, and tried to dissipate the painful
impressions she had brought away
from their two visits, by praising the
major’s military frankness and the
aristocratic bearing of the sisters.
But he was at a loss to explain why
the apartments of the Stolzenfels and
Bildmanns were richly and sumptuously
furnished and decorated, whilst
those the owners of the castle occupied
exhibited little beside bare walls.
Meanwhile the right and left wings,
between whom there had been a sort
of hollow alliance since the reading of
the will, assembled in conclave. Never
was there such a voiding of venom.
The self-same idea had occurred to
all these disappointed and charitable
relations. Edith’s beauty at once explained
the count’s frequent absence
from home and his unjust will. She
was the syren that had led him astray.
Little Margaret was his very image.
It was a crying shame, a burning
scandal. The old maids clasped their
hands and rolled their eyes. Ulrica
was for attacking the will on the
ground of immoral influence and captivation.
The major had always been
of the same opinion, but Frederick
would not agree, and nothing should
induce the major to fight a member
of his family. The fact was, notwithstanding
his Bobadil airs, Major Bildmann
had very little fancy for fighting
with anybody. The council broke
up, all its members declaring they
would quit the castle sullied by the
presence of these adventurers—all
fully resolved to remain and to wait
the course of events.</p>

<p class='c010'>We must compress into a few lines
the leading incidents of the second half
of <cite><span lang="fr">Un Héritage</span></cite>. Müller had not
been a month at the castle, when
great annoyances succeeded to the
petty disagreeables he had encountered
on his first arrival. Master
Wolfgang the Hildesheim lawyer was
his evil genius. There was a certain
lawsuit, that had already lasted
through three generations, in which,
as Count Sigismund’s heir, he found
himself entangled. The whole matter
in dispute was but half an acre of
land, which Müller would gladly have
abandoned, but Wolfgang proved to
him, as clear as day, the impropriety
of so doing, the disrespect to
the memory of the late count, and so
forth—and, the most cogent argument
of all, he exhibited to him the
sum total of the costs he would have
to pay if he admitted himself vanquished.
It was an alarming figure,
and ready money was not abundant
with Müller, whom the Stolzenfels
and Bildmanns dunned for their first
year’s annuity and for the legacy to
little Isaac; who had to pay for extensive
repairs of the castle, for the
costly mausoleum which, in the first
effusion of his gratitude, he had
ordered for Count Sigismund, and
various other charges. So the lawsuit
went on—the delight of Master
Wolfgang, and a daily drain upon
Müller’s purse. The harvest was bad,
the farmers asked for time, and grumbled
when worse terms than their own
were proposed to them. Careless
Count Sigismund had spoiled all
around him by letting them do as they
liked, and Müller’s greater activity
and vigilance, and his attempts to
check fraud and peculation, speedily
earned him the ill-will of the whole
neighbourhood. Gentle-hearted Edith,
anxious to expend a portion of her
sudden wealth in improving the condition
of the poor, was soon disgusted
by their ingratitude, and was utterly
at a loss to understand the chilling
looks, ironical smiles, and mysterious
whisperings of which she was the
object whenever she went beyond the
limits of her own park, to which she
soon confined herself. Her servants
showed no sense of the kindness with
which she treated them; they, too,
had adopted and spread the vile rumours
first set abroad by the malice
of the two vixen spinsters and of the
Bildmanns, with respect to the count’s
real motives for bequeathing his estates
to the Müllers. Fortunately it was
impossible for Edith, who was purity
itself, ever to suspect the real cause of
the ill-will shown to her. Captain
Frederick, when his regimental duties
permitted him to visit the castle, discovered
at a first interview, with a
rake’s usual clear-sightedness in such
matters, the utter falseness of the injurious
reports in circulation. He became
a constant visitor to the Müllers,
and was in fact their only friend
and resource in the solitude in which
they lived; for the neighbouring
squires, the <em>hobereaus</em> of the country
around, had not returned Müller’s
visits, nor taken any notice of him
beyond attacking him at law; some
upon a question of water-power,
which he had innocently diminished
by winding a stream that ran through
his grounds, others for damage done
to their fields, by the trespasses of
the Hildesheim hounds, followed by
Captain Frederick and his huntsmen.
Nor was this all—there was discord yet
nearer home: Müller’s children, having
trespassed upon the Bildmanns’ private
garden, were brutally ejected by
the major, whom Müller angrily reproached.
The major bullied and insisted
upon satisfaction, which Franz,
exasperated by a long series of annoyances,
was perfectly willing to give
him, and a duel would have ensued
had not the major, when he saw that
the musician, as he contemptuously
called him, meant to fight, sent an
apology. It was accepted, but next
day Müller ordered his three gardeners
to root up and clear away the
hedges of the Stolzenfels and Bildmann
enclosures. The knaves remonstrated
and finally refused, and,
when dismissed, they refused to
go, alleging that the late count’s
will deprived Müller of the power
of sending them away. More
work for the lawyers. Müller sent
for labourers, and the hedges disappeared.
Notices of action from the
ladies Stolzenfels and Major Bildmann.
The villain Wolfgang chuckled
and rubbed his hands, upon which he
had now six lawsuits for Müller’s account.
In the count’s crack-brained
will, drawn up by himself, without
legal advice, the letter was everywhere
at variance with the spirit.
Müller’s apartment was encumbered
with law papers; he could not sit
down to his piano, to seek oblivion
of his cares in his beloved art, without
being interrupted by Wolfgang’s
parchment physiognomy. As for composition,
it was out of the question:
he had no time for it, nor was his
harassed mind attuned to harmony.
He became morose and fanciful, jealous
of the hussar’s attention to Edith,
who, for her part, grieved to see her
husband so changed, and sighed for
the cottage at Munich, where Spiegel,
meanwhile, had worked hard, had
sold some pictures, had paid the rent
that Franz, in the midst of his troubles,
had forgotten to remit to him, and
had purchased, with the fruits of his
own toil and talent, the little dwelling
of which, when their prosperity first
burst upon them, the Müllers had
planned to make him a present. The
contrast was striking between anticipation
and realisation.</p>

<p class='c010'>No schoolboy ever more eagerly
longed for “breaking-up” day, than
did Müller for the termination of his
nine month’s compulsory abode at
Hildesheim. It came at last, and he
and Edith and their children were
free to quit the scene of strife and
weariness, and to return to Munich
and to Spiegel. On making up the
accounts of the year, Müller found
that, out of the whole princely revenue
of the estates, he had but a thousand
florins left. He had lived little better
than at Munich (much less happily),
and had committed no extravagance;
annuities, legacies, repairs, monument,
did not account for half the sum
expended; all the rest had gone in
law expenses. There remained about
enough to pay travelling charges to
Munich. Müller sent for Wolfgang,
forbade him to begin any new lawsuit
in his absence, and departed.
He found a warm welcome at the
cottage. Spiegel received his friends
with open arms, and three happy
months passed rapidly away. Upon
the last day, when Edith and Franz
were looking ruefully forward to their
return to Hildesheim’s grandeur
and countless disagreeables, Spiegel
insisted upon their accompanying
him to the performance of a new symphony,
concerning which the musical
world of Munich was in a state of considerable
excitement. The piece, it
was mysteriously related, was from
the pen of a deceased composer, was
of remarkable originality and beauty,
and had been casually discovered
amongst a mass of old papers. The
concert-room was crowded. At the
first bars of the music, Müller thought
he recognised familiar sounds, and
presently every doubt was dissipated.
It was his own composition—the despised
symphony he had been about
to destroy, but which Spiegel had
rescued. The audience, at the close
of each part, were rapturous in their
applause. When the finale had been
played, the composer’s name was called
for with acclamations. The leader
of the orchestra advanced, and proclaimed
that of Franz Müller.</p>

<p class='c010'>A few days later, Master Gottlieb
the notary received a letter from the
lord of Hildesheim. “According to
the stipulations of the will,” Müller
wrote, “I am bound to inhabit the
castle of Hildesheim for nine months
in the year. I remain at Munich and
forfeit my right to the property.”
Forthwith began a monster lawsuit,
one of the finest Master Wolfgang had
known in the whole course of his experience.
It was between the Bildmanns
and the Stolzenfels. It lasted
ten years. The major and Dorothy
died before it was decided, Isaac fell
from a tree, when stealing fruit, and
broke his neck. The Stolzenfels
triumphed. The hussar redoubled his
extravagance. The estate, already
encumbered with law expenses, was
sold to pay his debts. Ulrica and
Hedwige died in poverty.</p>

<p class='c010'>It ought surely not to have been
difficult for practised dramatists to
construct a pleasant and piquant comedy
out of the leading idea and
plentiful incidents of this amusing
novel, which is by no means the less
to be esteemed because it boldly
deviates from the long-established
routine, which demands a marriage as
the wind-up of every book of the
class. It is much more common in
France than in England for play-writers
to seek their subjects in novels
of the day, and it is then customary,
often indispensable, to take great liberties
both with plot and characters,
and sometimes to retain little besides
the main idea of the book. Upon that
idea there is of course no prohibition
against improving, but authors who
vary it for the worse, manifestly do
themselves a double injury, because
the public, familiar with the merits of
the book, are disgusted to find it deteriorated
in the play. They look for
something better, not worse, in the
second elaboration of the subject, and
certainly they have a right to do so,
and to be dissatisfied when the contrary
is the case. In the present instance,
a most unpleasant play has
been based upon a good novel. In
Emile Augier, M. Sandeau has taken
to himself a dangerous <em>collaborateur</em>.
He should have dramatised <cite><span lang="fr">Un Héritage</span></cite>
unassisted—as he dramatised,
with such happy results, his novel of
<cite><span lang="fr">Mademoiselle de la Seiglière</span></cite>. That
is a most successful instance of the
French style of adaptation to the
stage. There, too, as in the present
case, great liberties have been taken.
In two out of the four acts, scarcely
anything is to be traced of the novel,
which has as tragical an ending as
the comedy has a cheerful and pleasant
one. But the whole tenor of the
play was genial and sympathetic. In
the <cite>Pierre de Touche</cite>, as the present
comedy is called, the reverse is the
case, and no wonder that its cynical
and exaggerated strain jarred on the
feelings of the usually quiet audience
at the <em>Française</em>, and elicited hisses
rarely heard within those decorous
walls, where silence and empty benches
are the only tokens the public usually
give of its disapprobation. From our
acquaintance with M. Sandeau’s writings,
we do not think that he would
of himself have perpetrated such a repulsive
picture of human nature as he
has produced in combination with M.
Augier. They have obliterated or
distorted most of the best features of
the novel. In <cite><span lang="fr">Un Héritage</span></cite>, the character
of Franz Müller is at once
pleasing and natural. He is not represented
as perfect—he has his failings
and weaknesses like any other mortal,
and they are exhibited in the book,
although we have not, in the outline
we have traced of it, had occasion to
give them prominence. But his heart
is sound to the last. Wealth may momentarily
bewilder, but it does not
pervert him. He is true to his affections,
and has the sense and courage
to accept honourable toil as preferable
to a fortune embittered by anxiety
and dissension. The reader cannot
help respecting him, and feeling pained
at his countless vexations and annoyances.
No such sympathy is possible
with the Franz of the play, who is
the most contemptible of mortals. A
more unpleasant character was probably
never introduced into any book,
and it is untrue to nature, for it has
not a single redeeming point. The
authors have personified and concentrated
in it the essences of heartlessness,
selfishness, and of the most
paltry kind of pride. Somewhat indolent,
and with a latent spark of
envy in his nature, the needy artist,
converted into a millionaire, suddenly
displays his evil instincts. Their
growth is as supernaturally rapid as
that of noxious weeds in a tropical
swamp. The play opens in the cottage
at Munich. Edith, Franz’s
cousin, is not yet married to him.
An orphan, she had been brought up
by his father, at whose death Franz
took charge of her. She was then a
child, and Franz and Spiegel hardly
perceived that she had become a woman
until they were reminded of it by
the passion with which she inspired
both of them. Spiegel, a noble character,
generously sacrifices to his
friend’s happiness his own unsuspected
love. Edith (the names are changed
in the play, but we retain them to
avoid confusion) is affianced to her
cousin, and on the eve of marriage.
Just then comes the fortune. The
authors have substituted for the Bildmanns
and Stolzenfels an elderly
spendthrift baron and an intriguing
margravine and her pretty daughter.
The love passages in the life of the
deceased count are cancelled, and he
is represented as an eccentric old
gentleman, passionately fond of music,
and cherishing a great contempt for
his very distant relations, to whom
he leaves only a moderate annuity.
They have scarcely become acquainted
with Franz when they discern the
weak points in his character and conspire
to profit by them. Treated with
cutting contempt, as a mere <em>parvenu</em>,
by the haughty nobility of Bavaria,
Franz’s pride boils over, and he consents
to be adopted by the baron and
converted into the Chevalier de Berghausen,
at the immoderate price of
the payment of the old <em>roué</em> nobleman’s
debts. He finds Spiegel a
wearisome Mentor; to his diseased
vision Edith appears awkward contrasted
with the courtly dames he
now encounters. Their marriage is
postponed from week to week, by
reason of the journeys and other steps
necessary to establish Franz in the
ranks of the nobility of the land.
Titled, and with armorial bearings
that date from the crusades, how much
more fitting an alliance, the baron
perfidiously suggests, would be that of
the margravine, who graciously condescends
to intimate her possible acceptance
of him as a son-in-law.
We are shown the gangrene of selfishness
and vanity daily spreading
its corruption through his soul. He
quarrels with his honest, generous
friend, slights his affianced bride, and
finally falls completely into the clutches
of the intriguers who beset him.
His very dog, poor faithful Spark,
(his dog and Spiegel’s)—which, as the
painter, with tears in his eyes and a
cheek pale with anger and honest indignation,
passionately reminds him—had
slept on his feet and been his comfort
and companion in adversity—is
killed by his order because he did
not appreciate the difference between
castle and cottage, but took his ease
upon the dainty satin sofas at Hildesheim
as upon the rush mat at
Munich. Edith, compelled to despise
the man she had loved, preserves her
womanly dignity, and breaks off the
projected marriage just as the last
glimmer of honour and affection are
on the point of being extinguished in
her cousin’s bosom by the dictates of
a despicable vanity. The curtain
falls, leaving him in the hands of his
hollow friends, and allowing the spectator
to foresee the union of Edith
and Spiegel. Not one kindly touch of
natural feeling redeems Franz’s faithlessness
to his friend, and to his love
his ingratitude—for he would many a
day have been hungry, if not houseless,
but for the generous toil of
Spiegel, who had devoted himself to
the drudgery of teaching, that Franz
might have leisure to mature the
genius for which his partial friend
gave him exaggerated credit—his false
pride and his ridiculous vanity. He is
left rich, but miserable. That which
he has wilfully lost can be dispelled
neither by the enjoyments wealth
procures, nor by the false friends who
hang on him but to plunder him. In
their vindication, the authors insist
on “the terrible morality” of their
<em>denouement</em>. We admit it, but do not
the less persist in the opinion that
their play, although by no means devoid
of wit and talent, leaves a most
painful and disagreeable impression
upon the mind. It presents the
paradoxical and complicated phenomenon
of a comedy which has been
censured by press and public and yet
continues to be performed; which
draws tolerably numerous audiences,
and is invariably received with symptoms
of disapprobation.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>NEWS FROM THE FARM.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“The Ayrshire Ploughman,” glorious
Burns, tells us that the muse of
his country found him, as Elijah did
Elisha, at the plough, and threw her
inspiring mantle over him. Grateful
Caledonia sent her inspired child to
an excise office! and in the discriminating
patronage the wits of Grub
Street found material for interminable
sneers. Did the Southerns, however,
reward the author of the “Farmer’s
Boy,” and indicate their appreciation
of the many fine passages that grace
his “News from the Farm,” by a
wiser or more generous patronage?
The minister of the day (Lord Sidmouth,
if we remember rightly) did
bestow upon the poet some most
paltry and ungenial office; but alas!
poor Bloomfield died neglected in the
straits of penury, and under the clouds
of dejection. It had been better indeed,
in every way, could it have been
so arranged that the marvellous Robin
should have been allowed to sing his
lyrics</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

</div>

<p class='c016'>and that Bloomfield had been permitted
to indite more “News from the
Farm” amid the pleasant rural scenes
that nursed his pastoral muse. But
the patronage of genius has never
been successful. Unusual peril seems
the heritage of high gifts, and to
minister rightly to such a man as
Burns or Bloomfield is no easy task.
It is not so with ordinary men, whose
intellectual and imaginative powers
harmonise with the common duties of
their station, and raise no splendid
incongruities to be subdued and regulated.
But it is not with inspired
ploughmen that our country gentlemen
and tenant-farmers are called
upon to deal, but with men of common
clay—with the brawny peasants
who till their fields and tend their
herds, and whose toil has turned the
sterile North into a garden of Ceres.
Have our agricultural labourers been
neglected—have their physical wellbeing
and their moral and educational
training been overlooked and left uncared
for, while the classes above them
and around them have had their comforts
and privileges, moral and social,
infinitely multiplied? This were indeed
sad “news from the farm;”
but although this were unhappily
proved to be true, we are not then
prepared to pronounce sweeping censure
upon the parties apparently most
nearly implicated in the degradation
of our rural population. Many, very
many, of the owners and occupants
of the soil, we know, are deeply alive
to the duties which they owe to the
labouring poor who live under them,
and discharge them to the best of
their ability, although not, it may
be, to the extent their benevolent
wishes would desire. The question
that may be raised on such a subject
is not, Have our rural labourers been
left stationary while the classes above
them have all been elevated in their
social condition? but rather, Are they
worse off, and do they enjoy fewer
advantages, than those in the same
class of life—the industrious poor who
inhabit our large cities and manufacturing
towns and villages? Is the
ploughman in his bothy unfurnished
with table or chair, and the peasant
in his “clay-built biggin,” damp and
smoky though it be, more miserably
accommodated with the comforts and
conveniences of life than the haggard
sons of toil, who are doomed to burrow
in the murky lanes and blind alleys
of our teeming seats of merchandise?
Does the brawny arm and ruddy complexion
of the ploughman bespeak
deficient food or raiment, and manifest
such dubious symptoms of health as
the pinched countenance and pallid
complexion of the attenuated artisans
who live in “populous city pent?”
Yes, responds promptly the inhabitant
of the city; but that robust health is
not due to the miserable bothy and the
mud cabin, but to the pure air of the
country, and the breezy gales of incense-breathing
morn, and the healthful
toil of the open field, which are the
unchartered boons of a gracious
Heaven, and in no respect the gifts
of the lords of the soil. In the rejoinder
of Mr Urbanus there is no
doubt substantial truth; but that
very rejoinder, perhaps, contains an
explanation of the neglect pointed
at. The robust health of the peasant
has not admonished the country
gentleman of duty neglected, and
no emaciated frame and loopholed
raggedness have appealed to his
sympathies and rebuked his indifference.
The opulent inhabitants of our
cities have been addressed in a different
strain, and the deadly typhus and
the inscrutable plague of Asia have
been the stern preachers to which
they have been doomed to listen. If
they have led the van in reformatory
and sanitary measures for improving
the social condition of the industrious
poor, it is not very evident that their
philanthropy has been quite spontaneous,
or that it has been altogether
uninfluenced by considerations suggested
by a regard to their own personal
safety and selfish interest.
Those who may be disposed to range
the country against the town, or
curious to strike the balance of merit
in the field of philanthropic enterprise
betwixt our merchant princes and our
country gentlemen, may prosecute
such inquiries as have been indicated
if they please; but for ourselves, we
have no taste for such unprofitable
investigation, and would rather lend
a helping hand to a most interesting
movement that has been lately originated
towards improving the social
condition of our agricultural labourers—a
most loyal and peaceful race,
forming, upon the whole, the best-conditioned
part of the industrious
classes of the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thanks to the Rev. Harry Stuart,
of Oathlaw, if not for having originated
the movement, for having at
least given it a most unquestionable
impetus, and for indicating the direction
which it ought to take. We
have read his <em>Agricultural Labourers</em>,
&#38;c., with remarkable interest
and pleasure—a pleasure very different,
and we believe much higher, than
the most elaborate writing of the most
brilliant pamphleteer could have given
us. Mr Stuart, indeed, has nothing of
the <em>littérateur</em> about him, and his style
is the very reverse of artistic. He
tells us that his appeal has been “got
up in great haste,” but we scarcely
think it could have been better had
more time been devoted to its composition.
It had been no improvement,
in our estimation, had his Essay
been tricked out in rhetorical embroidery,
and been embellished with well-poised
and finely-polished periods.
We are quite sick of the flash and
sparkle of the journalists, of their
stilted eloquence and startling antithesis.
The editor of every country
newspaper writes nowadays as grandly
as Macaulay, and apes to the very life
“the long-resounding march and
energy divine” of Burke and Bolingbroke.
It is really a relief in these
times to be spoken to in plain, natural,
homespun English. When an honest
gentleman has anything of importance
to communicate, for ourselves we are
very well pleased that he should use
the vernacular, and address us in
simple Anglo-Saxon. This is exactly
what Mr Stuart has done. He writes
from a full heart, and is manifestly so
possessed with his theme that he has
had no time to think of the belles-lettres
and the art rhetorical. The
minister of Oathlaw is peradventure
no popular orator, and has never
probably paraded himself on the platform,
and his name is in all likelihood
unknown to the sermon-fanciers of
Edinburgh, but nevertheless he is
quite a pastor to our taste. Living
without pride amongst his people,
going from house to house, knowing
well the trials of every household, a
patient listener to the homely annals
of the poor, catechising the young,
exhorting the unruly, helping the
aged to trim their lamps and gird up
their loins, we can understand how
well and how quietly this worthy
clergyman discharges the duties of the
pastorate, reaping a nobler guerdon
in the love of those amongst whom he
lives and labours than ever the noisy
trump of fame blew into ambition’s
greedy ear. We rejoice to think that
there are many such pastors in our
country parishes, who, with their
families, constitute sympathetic links
of kindly communication betwixt the
rich and the poor, and from whom, as
from centres of civilisation, are shed
on all around the gentle lights of literary
refinement and Christian charity.
These are the men who form the
strength of our Established Church,
and not her doctors and dignitaries;
and, indeed, over our retired rural
parishes it is evident that nothing
but an endowed resident parochial
clergy can permanently exert the
beneficent influence of the pastoral
office.</p>

<p class='c010'>The origin of Mr Stuart’s address
he states as follows: He became a
member of the Forfarshire Agricultural
Association upon the understanding,
that the improvement of the
social condition of the agricultural
labourers was to be one of the objects
to which the Association should direct
its attention. Such seems to have
been the intention of the society, or
at least its committee were so ready
to welcome the idea, that they forthwith
asked Mr Stuart to address
them upon the subject, and he did so
accordingly. His auditors were so
pleased, and, it may be, so instructed,
that they requested the author to
publish his address; and under the
auspices of the Forfarshire Association
it has been given to the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have often thought that each of
our counties has a distinct character
of its own, and is distinguished by
features peculiar to itself. While the
Forfarshire coast has its populous
towns, the seats of mercantile enterprise,
and of thriving manufactures, the
county has likewise been long eminent
for its agriculture. By the symmetry
and beauty of his Angusshire “doddies,”
Hugh Watson of Keillor has
made the county famous for its cattle.
In Forfarshire, Henry Stephens practised
the art which he has so admirably
illustrated in his book. The son
of a small farmer in this county, while
a student at college, invented and
elaborated, without aid or patronage,
in a rude workshop, that reaper which
American ambition has now so covered
with fame. Forfarshire gentlemen,
although non-resident, are not
disposed to forget the claims of their
native county, and by means of “the
Angusshire Society” they annually
distribute among its schools numerous
prizes, thus countenancing the cause
of education throughout the county,
stimulating its ingenious youth to exertion,
and animating its teachers in
their honourable toil. And now the
Forfarshire Agricultural Society, under
the mild appeals of the Pastor of Oathlaw,
have led the way in organising
an association for raising the social
condition of the agricultural labourers
of the kingdom. So all hail to old
Angus!—and may her proprietors,
pastors, and tenant-farmers long be
eminent in their spheres of duty, and
cordially unite in the field of benevolent
enterprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Stuart’s pamphlet has been
extensively read by landed proprietors
and the better classes of our
farmers. We wish it were universally
so by these parties; and we wish, too,
it were read and inwardly digested by
the factors and agents to whom our
large proprietors have committed the
conduct of their business, and the care
of their properties, and the welfare of
those who cultivate them. It is impossible
to read the speeches of the
most interesting meeting held here on
the 10th January last, and presided
over by his Grace the Duke of Buccleuch,
without feeling that Mr Stuart’s
pamphlet has literally proved
“news from the farm” to very many
of the owners and occupiers of the
soil—the very parties who ought to
know best the habits and discomforts
of our agricultural labourers. It is
very remarkable, indeed, that the Duke
of Buccleuch seems accurately informed
upon the subject; that he has
personally inspected the dwellings
of the agricultural labourers on his
estate; and that he has personally
issued instructions regarding the improvement
of their cottages. Considering
the territorial extent of his
Grace’s estates, and the varied and
momentous interests that claim and
receive his Grace’s attention, his conduct
and example, as well as his benevolent
and patriotic words, will
carry a severer reproof to those landowners
who shall hereafter continue
indifferent to the comfort and welfare
of the labourers, than the most biting
speech of the most pungent pamphleteer.
Why, it may be asked, has
Mr Stuart been left to make such
a discovery? Why did the tenant-farmers,
who are daily witnessing
with their own eyes the discomforts
of the agricultural labourers, who are
most deeply interested in their physical
and moral condition, and to whom
Providence has more immediately
committed the care of their interests—why
did they not complain, and call
for some amelioration of an evil so
discreditable? But the fact is, that
such men as Messrs Watson, Finnie,
Cowie, and many others we might
name, have never ceased to avail
themselves of every opportunity of
directing attention to the condition of
our agricultural labourers, but they
have heretofore, for the most part,
addressed themselves to unprepared
and reluctant audiences. Moreover,
for many years our tenant-farmers
have been struggling with such difficulties
of their own, as have left them
little time or inclination for devising
expedients for improving the condition
of their labourers. And it is likewise
to be remembered that many of
the farmers are themselves so little
elevated above the peasantry in point
of education and habits and domestic
tastes, that it would be idle to expect
that they should see any necessity for
elevating the condition of the agricultural
labourers.</p>

<p class='c010'>This class of tenants must consider
the present movement as fantastic,
and absurd, and uncalled for, and they
will prove, we fear, the greatest obstructives
in the way of its success.
So that if the truth is to be spoken,
many proprietors would require first
to improve the habits and elevate the
character of their tenantry, before they
attempt to elevate the social condition
of their agricultural labourers. The
nearer the tenant approaches the labourer
in point of education and social
habits, the more careless and indifferent
is the former to the comforts of
the latter, and the less inclined to
ameliorate his condition. We think
it by no means an impossible thing
that there are not a few farmers
throughout Scotland who are looking
upon the present movement in behalf
of our rural labourers not only as savouring
of idle sentimentalism, but
who are contemplating it with a jealous
eye, as an attempt of the proprietors
to place the condition of the servant
upon the same platform with that of
the master. There is, indeed, a class
of small farmers, highly estimable and
worthy, and quite fit, in respect of
capital, for their position, who cultivate
their possessions by means of
their own families, aided by perhaps
one or two servant-lads. In these
cases the servants live truly as members
of the family, and are treated as
such; and this is the farm-service
which, above all others, virtuous and
thoughtful parents desire for their
children.</p>

<p class='c010'>The tenant-farmers are, probably,
likewise prepared to rebut any charge
of indifference brought against them,
by stating that they have found so
great difficulty in getting proper house-accommodation
for their own families,
and suitable and enlarged farm-buildings
to enable them satisfactorily
to carry on the business of the farm,
and to meet the requirements of an
improved husbandry, that the idea of
asking a better style of cottages
for their labourers would have been
Utopian. The farmer, too, has but
a temporary interest in the land,
and but a temporary connection with
the agricultural labourers upon his
farm; and with more immediate
wants and difficulties of his own to
contend with, to suppose that he should
expostulate with a reluctant proprietor,
and set himself devotedly to improve
and remodel the houses of his
labourers, is to expect from him an
extent of philanthropic enthusiasm
quite uncommon, and, therefore, quite
unreasonable. The landowner occupies
a very different position—but,
however inexplicable it may seem, he
has not hitherto had his attention
directed to the cottages of the labouring
poor upon his estate. This confession
of previous ignorance was ingenuously
made by the speakers at the
Edinburgh meeting, and we believe
that they did not misrepresent the
information upon the subject that had
hitherto generally prevailed among
the landed proprietors of Scotland.
Lord Kinnaird, at a meeting of the
“Dundee Model Lodging-House Association,”
on 13th January, expressed
himself as follows: “Until he had
read that pamphlet (Mr Stuart’s), he
had had no right idea of the bothies
on his estate. Thinking such a matter
was an arrangement purely between
the farmer and his labourers, he had
not visited them till lately; but having
now done so, he felt they were a reproach
to him, and must be improved.”
And yet Lord Kinnaird resides for the
most part upon his estate—he takes
an anxious and most kindly interest
in the moral, educational, and physical
wellbeing of the people who live upon
it,—and having such an acknowledgment
from a nobleman so benevolent
and active, the irresistible inference
is, that other proprietors in his position
are not only ignorant of the
bothies, but of the condition of the
cottages upon their properties.</p>

<p class='c010'>It appears from Mr Stuart, that the
parochial clergy, the body to which
he belongs, have for many years had
their attention anxiously directed towards
the case of the agricultural
labourers. He tells us that the synods
of Perth, Stirling, Aberdeen, and Angus
and Mearns have instituted inquiries
regarding their condition—these inquiries
being chiefly intended, as
might have been expected, to ascertain
the moral, religious, and educational
state of our labourers, although the
effects of the bothy system and of feeing-markets
upon the social condition
of servants are likewise investigated.
Through the courtesy of a clerical correspondent,
we have before us reports
from twenty-seven parishes in Morayshire,
in answer to a series of questions
circulated by the synod of Moray in
1848, as well as a copy of the <cite>Elgin
Courant</cite>, April 1848, containing a very
full discussion by that ecclesiastical
court on the moral and social condition
of the agricultural labourers of
that province. The synod of Angus
and Mearns instituted an investigation
of the same kind some fifteen years
ago, and a most elaborate report, based
upon the information collected, was
drawn up. Measures were suggested
for elevating the condition of the farm-servants;
and in some counties pastoral
addresses were read from the
pulpits of the Established Church
upon the subject. It appears, however,
that this agitation of the question
by the Church met with no countenance
or encouragement from the laity.
We know, indeed, that Sir John
Stuart Forbes, and two or three
other proprietors, took <em>then</em> an interest
in the inquiry, and were alive to its
importance—but, generally speaking,
the proprietors and farmers seem to
have been quite unprepared to take up
the subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is very curious, nevertheless, to
observe that the very evils pointed out
by Mr Stuart in his pamphlet, and
the very remedies suggested by him,
are all embraced and expounded in
the reports of the ecclesiastical courts
now before us.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c008'><sup>[6]</sup></a> It is a remarkable
instance, apparently, of the well-known
mental phenomenon, that the
mind previously must have undergone
some preparation for the reception of
the truth, before the truth can suitably
affect it. Mr Stuart has had the
sagacity, or good fortune, to fix upon
the opportune moment for making his
appeal, and to find a benevolently
disposed auditory. He has done what
his brethren, in synods assembled,
could not do. He has effectually hit
the nail upon the head—and we hope
he will reiterate the blow again and
again, until he sees the objects of his
benevolent wishes in some good measure
obtained.</p>

<p class='c010'>It appears to us that on such a subject
as the present every thing approaching
to exaggeration should be most
anxiously avoided. There is a danger,
now that the attention and interest
of the public have been so awakened,
that overdrawn pictures of the degraded
condition of our Scottish peasantry
will be indulged in; and this
is all the more likely, as proving acceptable
to the democratic classes,
and as reflecting disgrace on the character
of landed proprietors. In point
of fact, we believe that it is unquestionable
that our rural population,
both in respect of their sanitary and
moral condition, occupy a position
very superior to that of the manufacturing
classes of our towns. By the
census of 1841, for every two deaths
in agricultural districts there were
more than three in our towns; and
in towns exclusively manufacturing,
such as Leeds and Birmingham, there
were seven deaths for every two in
agricultural localities. Glasgow is
the only Scottish town where the statistics
of mortality are noted, and
there ten would die out of a population
of three hundred, while out of
the same number in agricultural counties
there would be only three deaths.
In the matter of moral statistics by
the same census the commitments
in manufacturing districts, compared
with agricultural, were as five to one.
We believe the statistics of drunkenness
would report likewise in favour
of the superior sobriety of our rural
population, so that our agricultural
labourers, it seems, are truly more
healthy, more sober, more virtuous,
at least in the eye of the criminal law,
than those of the labouring classes in
our towns. We believe that the agricultural
labourers are better fed and
better clothed, and, in many aspects
of the case, as well housed as the labouring
classes in our large towns
and cities. In this fashion, if he
pleases, the landowner may evade all
appeals to his benevolence, and may
scornfully reject all reproachful insinuations
of having neglected the
condition of the labouring poor upon
his estates. He may well inquire
how far he has contributed to raise
the poor on his estate to a higher
social condition in respect of health
and sobriety, when contrasted with
the poor of our towns; and if this
has not been so much the necessary
result of their circumstances and manner
of life, that a very slender portion
of the merit can be appropriated by
him. The opulent inhabitants of our
cities are not bound by any especial
tie of social duty to the degraded and
dissipated poor of the cities. They
are not their tenants, nor are they
engaged in their employment. Though
living in close proximity with them,
the rich are, for the most part, profoundly
ignorant of the condition of
their poorer fellow-citizens, who
breathe the mephitic exhalations
of unventilated lanes, and whose
homes are but dismal cellars, into
which the meridian sun, struggling
through dense masses of hovering
vapour, fails to transmit anything
stronger than a murky twilight.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the country gentleman can persuade
himself that he holds no nearer
relationship to the tenantry and labourers
upon his estate, than the
wealthy citizen does to the industrious
poor who live within the same
municipal bounds, but who otherwise
are totally unconnected with them,
it would be unreasonable to expect
from such a one those expressions of
regret which have fallen so gracefully
from the lips of others, or that he will
find any difficulty in escaping all appeals
addressed to him, not only as
he is not conscious of having overlooked
any duty, but because he is
prepared to deny that he has any
duty to discharge in the matter. Or
if the country gentleman can take up
the very elevated position which a certain
school of economists have of late
been expounding and pressing upon his
attention, then he will have reached
a region so pure, and so superterrestrial
as to be infinitely raised above all
vulgar care about the comfort and
welfare of those who till the glebe
and tend the herds of that “dim spot
which men call earth.” According
to this high philosophy, the landowner
is taught to look upon his land as a
mere article of commerce, and that
the great question with him ought to
be to discover how, with the least
possible outlay, he can raise from it
the greatest possible revenue. To
examine into the condition of the
cottages upon the estate—to build
new ones, and to improve the old—to
do this personally, or, as that may
be impossible, to order it to be done
by some competent and responsible
party—all this seems out of his department
as the owner of the land and
the recipient of the rent. If the farmer
is content that his labourers should
live in miserable hovels, where their
physical energies must be debilitated,
and where the decencies of their moral
condition must suffer wrong, where
their fitness for their daily toil is being
impaired by the discomforts of their
homes, and where, from the same
cause, the period in the ploughman’s
life of complete capability for his work
must infallibly be abridged, what signifies
all this to the landowner? His
political economy saves him from all
compunction. If the thews and sinews
of the ploughman, by such treatment,
become prematurely useless, it matters
not—the wheels and pinions can
be replaced, and other thews and sinews
will be found to work the work. It
is a devout hallucination upon the
part of Mr Stuart to fancy that he can
persuade such a landowner as this,
that, on mere pecuniary grounds, it
would prove a wise economy in him
to build new cottages and to remodel
the old, and to improve and add to
the bothy accommodation. Mr Stuart’s
argument on such a subject
would necessarily be largely leavened
with moral considerations, which the
economics of the landlord did not embrace,
and the mere money-profit
looms dubiously in the distance. Mr
Stuart would have no chance with
such a stern philosopher as this, who
could demonstrate by an irrefragable
arithmetic that he could do the thing
cheaper! We are sorry to think that
any such party should be in the position
of a landed proprietor. ’Tis a
pity such a man had not had his
money invested in the Three per Cents,
or in a street of three-storeyed tenements
suitable to accommodate the
middle classes of society, who would
take care of themselves, and, peradventure,
of the laird likewise. We
know no situation in human life so
enviable as that of a country gentleman.
His privileges are manifold,
and his appropriate recreations and
pleasures exquisite. His peculiar
duties are indeed very responsible,
but they are deeply interesting and
delightful. Surely a country gentleman
is knit by dearer and more sacred
ties to the people that live upon his
estate, and that cultivate his fields,
than the rich man of the city to the
poor artisan, to whom he is united by
the accident of his living in the neighbouring
street. Nay, we hope that
no country gentleman would care to
be thought actuated by no warmer or
kindlier feelings towards the pendiclers
and poor cottagers that dwell on his
estate, than the potent noblesse of the
cotton-mills can reasonably be expected
to be towards the shadowy
troops of sallow girls that, like so
many animal automata, ply their
nimble fingers o’er the power-looms
and spinning-jennies of their tall-chimneyed
temples. If the accursed
commercial element is henceforth to
be the sole ruling motive in the
management of landed property, the
country gentleman will speedily sink
to the level of a commercial gentleman.
The charms of his position
will die away—the honours now so
spontaneously rendered to him will be
withheld—and the ancestral influence
of his house and name will become
the poet’s dream. We have contrasted
the condition of the labouring
poor in the country with that of the
labouring poor in the town, but there
can be no just comparison betwixt the
position of a landed proprietor, and
the duties which it entails towards
the agricultural labourers on his property,
and the position of a mill-spinner
towards the people whom he
employs; and we should be sorry if
any landowner should seek in this
way to vindicate his subsequent neglect
of the duties which Providence
has manifestly laid upon him. If our
landed proprietors are not imbued
with some just sense of the responsibilities
of their station, and actuated
by some steadfast determination to
practise self-denial in other matters,
that they may improve the condition
of the industrious poor upon their
properties, we despair utterly of any
permanent practical good resulting
from the present movement. If our
farmers are, as a body, not prepared
at present heartily to enter upon the
work of reformation, we have to thank
one class of politicians who have for
years been industriously indoctrinating
the farmer with the dogma that his
business, in its highest phase, was just
the manufacture of certain agricultural
products from the soil. The
farmer long listened in wonder to the
lecturer, not knowing well what the
high-sounding philosophy might mean.
But he at last embraced the doctrine,
and he now, we fear, too often entertains
the feelings which the doctrine
was so likely to engender. As a manufacturer,
the farmer cannot for his life
see that he has any more concernment
than any other manufacturer with the
condition, character, and habits of his
operatives. For a year he hires them,
and they go, and he sees them no
more. The root of the evil Mr Stuart
correctly traces up to the altered feelings
and conduct of proprietors and
tenants towards their dependants.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Stuart, in speaking of our
agricultural labourers, “as things
were” some sixty years ago, adverts
to a period when the servants lived in
family with their masters—when the
master sat patriarchally at the head
of his table, surrounded by his children
and domestics, and when all
knelt at the same family altar to offer
up the evening prayer. The social
characteristics of the people of that
day were excellent; but their creature
comforts were few, and their agriculture
wretched. It was the era of
run-rig, of outfield and infield—the
former being scourged as the common
foe—while on the latter our agricultural
sires practised high farming.
During the summer the men were
half idle, and in the winter they were
wholly so, saving that occasionally
in the forenoon that venerable implement
the flail, wielded by a lusty
arm, might be heard dropping its
minute-guns on the barn-floor. The
women wrought the work in summer,
and plied the wheel in winter. We
are old enough to remember the spinning-wheel,
and are disposed to echo
the sentiment of the poet—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Grief, thou hast lost an ever-ready friend,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now that the cottage spinning-wheel is mute;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And care a comforter that best could suit</div>
      <div class='line'>Her froward mood, and softliest reprehend.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Mr Stuart reverts to this bygone
age in a strain of tenderness; but he
faithfully depicts its grievous physical
disadvantages as they were experienced
by the poor. There is a dash
of romance in Mr Stuart’s genial
nature, and he has interwoven his
narrative with some quaint old-world
reminiscences; but his excellent sense
conducts him always to the sound
conclusion. He does not idly sigh
for that which has passed away; and
he sees that the habits of a former
age, if they could be recalled, would
not suit the taste of the present generation,
nor meet the exigencies of the
existing agriculture. In certain districts
of Aberdeenshire and elsewhere,
the farm-servants may be said yet to
live in the family—that is, they get
their food in the kitchen, and by the
kitchen-fire they sit in the winter
evenings until they retire to their
beds, which are generally in the
stable. But the master and his family
are meanwhile in the parlour. The
master’s restraining presence is not
in the kitchen; and upon the testimony
alike of farmers and of clergymen,
now lying upon our table, the
results of the system are so deplorable,
that bothies are asked for and preferred
as the least of two evils.</p>

<p class='c010'>In portraying the progress of agricultural
improvement, Mr Stuart discovers
the origin of the bothy and
bondager systems. The throwing two
or three farms into one, and the gradual
decay of the cot-houses, and the
aversion of the proprietor to build new
ones, from a mistaken economy, originated
both modes of accommodating
farm-servants. But if such were the
causes of the evil, its cure is self-evident.
We have only to retrace
our steps, and we will recover the
position which we have abandoned.
It took, however, half a century to
develop the evil, and not in a day can
we hope to see the remedy accomplished.
In building more cottages,
then, you take the sure way of mitigating
the evils of both systems; and
by proceeding in this work, if you do
not ultimately exterminate the evil,
you will so circumscribe and diminish
it that it must become all but innocuous.
The practice of enlarging
farms has gone far enough, but if the
expense of their subdivision were not
intolerable, we would not in this item
undo what we have done. There can
be no doubt that our large farmers
have been the great improvers; not
only have they led the way in improving
the cultivation of the soil and the
stock of the country, but they have
been the parties who have introduced
to public notice the new manures, and
the new and better implements of
husbandry, and to them we now look
as indispensable and powerful auxiliaries
in elevating the social condition
of the labourers. On the large farm,
all that is wanted is a proportionate increase
of cottages to accommodate the
staff of agricultural servants, with a
few houses on the outskirts of the
farm for jobbers and day-labourers,
whose assistance, with that of their
families, may be got at a busy season
on the farm.</p>

<p class='c010'>At all times, and in all places, and
by all sorts of people, the bothy is
condemned. Mr Stuart condemns
it, and laments the evils which it originates,
and the habits which it induces,
and the immoralities which it
cherishes; but we are sorry to think
that he writes so hopelessly about the
possibility of its extinction. We
would have been better pleased had
he pronounced its doom, and had he
proclaimed against it, in unmistakable
accents, a war of extermination,
gradual but sure, and inexorable. It
merits nothing but hearty and unhesitating
condemnation. We are well
acquainted with bothy economics, and
we never knew but one that was even
decently conducted. Mr Stuart seems
to think the evil necessary and irremovable,
and that the only thing left
to the philanthropist is to mitigate
its horrors. But why so? The bothy
system is partial and local. There
are large provinces of the kingdom
where it is totally unknown. We
have the ocular demonstration, then,
that it is not indispensable. But
Mr Stuart says, that in escaping
Charybdis, you sail the good ship
Agriculture straight into the boiling
quicksand of Syrtis—that, the bothy
abandoned, you irretrievably encounter
the evils of the bondager system.
We are humbly of opinion, however,
that our excellent friend somewhat
overstates the evils of this latter
system. There are inconveniences
and disadvantages connected with it,
but these are not for a moment to be
compared with the discomforts, and
with the temptations to nocturnal
rambling and loose living, with which
the bothy system is so beset. The
bondager system does not affect young
ploughman lads in the slightest degree;
it is limited to young women,
and to them the system is the same
as domestic service in the farmer’s
house, when field-work is associated
with that service. But Mr Stuart
seems to confound the bondager with
the cottage system, while in reality
they have no necessary connection.
There are two bugbears in the way of
abolishing the bothy—the one the landlords,
and the other the tenants. The
landlord is alarmed at the expense of
building the necessary cottages. This
will be got over. The tenant is
alarmed at the expense of maintaining
the ploughman in the cottage
when built—a most remarkable mistake.
But so it is that, be-north the
Forth, many farmers, from long habit,
and from ignorance of the cottage
system as it exists in the Border
counties, have become so wedded to
the bothy, that in accomplishing its
abolition we expect more resistance
from them than from landlords. The
model bothy, in mere material accommodation,
will effect nothing unless it
has separate apartments, furnished
with fire and light, and other necessary
appliances; and if it be so, where
will be its superior economy to either
landlord or tenant, when contrasted
with the expense of a separate cottage?
Abrogate the bothy system entirely,
for otherwise moralists may lament
in vain, and parents bewail the
ruined virtue of their children.</p>

<p class='c010'>Considering apparently the system
too firmly rooted to admit of eradication,
Mr Stuart strenuously inculcates
the instant improvement of the
bothy accommodation. But if he succeeds,
will he not have stereotyped
the bothy as a permanent part of the
economy and constitution of the farm;
and what, then, has been achieved?
The physical discomforts of the bothy
will have in a good measure disappeared,
but the place is not disinfected
of the moral contagion which the system
communicates. Let half-a-dozen
of ploughman lads be associated in a
bothy, and however tidy and snug
and commodious the apartments, yet
when their age and circumstances are
remembered—when it is considered
that they are without a head, to control,
counsel, and direct them, that
each is his own master—we confess
that to us it seems chimerical to expect
that any desirable measure of decency,
or sobriety, or order, will prevail
within the walls of the bothy. It
is in vain to tell a well-disposed
lad that he can escape the pollution
of a wicked associate in the bothy, by
retiring to his own apartment. How
can he sit there on a winter evening
(winter is the season when bothy
wickedness takes its swing), unaccommodated
as it is either with fire or
light? We fear, therefore, that the
“model bothy” even would not
arrest or extinguish the moral mischief
that emanates from this system.
It is remarkable that the speakers
at the Edinburgh meetings do not
say that they contemplate the
improvement of the bothy system.
Their resolution to encourage the
multiplication of suitable cottages for
the labourers on the farm, they saw,
involved in due time the extinction of
the bothy system. Moreover, we
fancy that neither the Duke of Buccleuch
nor the Marquis of Tweeddale
has a single bothy upon their estates,
unless one for the journeymen gardeners
in the vicinity of their residences.
Once erect a sufficiency of cottages, and
the unmarried lads will find a sister,
or aunt, or some female relative to keep
house for them. Having such an object
before them, they will be taught habits
of economy, and will save money, that
they may be ready to furnish a cottage.
Once in it, they have a home and property,
and will become attached to
their situation. The bothy turns
ploughmen into <em>nomads</em>, and gives
them restless, undomestic, and migratory
habits. Erect a sufficiency of
cottages, and the bothy will die a natural
death. No proprietor or tenant
will erect or maintain a bothy for a
solitary ploughman, who happens to
have no female friend who can cook
his food and keep his cottage. Infallibly
he will find other accommodation.
The boy, to whom the bothy is
a very school of corruption, ought to
live in family with the master, and it
should be the master’s duty to watch
over his morals, and to aid in some
manner in his education. If he is a
parent, let him say how he would
like his own boy, when he leaves
the paternal roof, to be neglected,
tempted, corrupted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Stuart quotes from Mr Laing’s
book on Norway a description of the
Norwegian <i><span lang="no">borststue</span></i> or bothy, which
is commodious and comfortable, and
well supplied with all conveniences;
and then he asks, “Now, I would
hold such to be a model bothy; and
cannot the farming in Scotland afford
to give what it affords to give in Norway?”
No doubt of it, provided
you demonstrate that the bothy is indispensable;
but to that premise we
demur. Mr Laing communicates nothing
to us of the moral effects of the
<i><span lang="no">borststue</span></i>, which would be modified by
the social habits of the people, and by
the degree of kindly intercourse subsisting
between master and servant.
But in fact the example of Norway,
neither in the matter of cottages nor
bothies, is truly applicable to our
country. In Norway the cottage is a
loghouse, and costs nothing but the
nails and the window-glass, while
every Norwegian knows enough of
loghouse-carpentry to erect a cottage
for himself. With regard to the
<i><span lang="no">borststue</span></i>, there is a necessity for it
in Norway that does not exist here.
The outdoor farm-work, which meets
with but partial interruptions in our
climate, is at an absolute standstill
in Norway for six months of the
year, from the severity of a protracted
winter. The result is, that
the outdoor work must be accomplished
during a few weeks in spring,
and of course a more numerous staff
of servants must be maintained than
with us; for, from the military and
passport system prevailing in Norway,
it is impossible to summon in an additional
supply of workers to suit the
emergency. The tenant-farmer is
thus more dependent on the agricultural
labourers; and we believe that
there prevails in Norway more of
that friendly interchange of sympathy
and of kindness between master and
servant than now unhappily characterises
our social condition, which,
nevertheless, sweetens all toil, and
turns aside the poisoned arrow of
temptation, and plucks the sting
from suffering, whether experienced
in Scottish bothy or Norwegian <i><span lang="no">borststue</span></i>.
For ourselves, we have only one
prescription for the bothy system, and
that is, raze it. The system is too
pregnant with all moral evil to be
temporised with. We cannot consent
to any parley, to negotiate for
delay, and to write protocols anent
its possible improvement. We are
almost certain that the minister of
Oathlaw agrees with us, but that he
has thought it prudent to soften his
voice when speaking of the bothy, in
the fear that it would alarm his auditors
at the revolutionary extent of
his demands. But now that he has
caught the ear of the noble and the
good of the land, and awakened in
generous hearts so magnanimous a
response, let the lute become a trumpet
in his hand, and let him blow a
blast so loud and clear as shall scatter
this disgrace of Scottish agriculture
to the winds of heaven.</p>

<p class='c010'>Most earnestly do we press upon
our readers that our Scottish peasantry,
and agricultural labourers, and
common ploughmen, are highly deserving
of consideration and kindness,
and of every attempt that can be
made to increase their comforts and to
ameliorate their moral and social condition.
There is an incredible and
most criminal ignorance not only
among the higher, but among the
middle classes of society, regarding
at once the habits and hardships of
this important class of the community.
The newspaper paragraphist, in his select
vocabulary, describes the ploughman
as a clown, a clodpole, a lout.
That smart draper, with the exquisitely-tied
cravat and his inimitably
arranged hair, all redolent of musk,
smiles complacently when he sees
John the hind rolling along the pavement
on his huge hobnailed boots,
and considers him the very impersonation
of stolidity. John’s dress is
appropriate, however, to his calling,
and to see the draper in pumps and
silk stockings floundering through a
new-ploughed field, or picking his
steps daintily through a feeding-byre,
where the musk must yield to the
ammonia, would, we fancy, be a phenomenon
not less provocative of laughter.
Nothing is so ridiculous as the
very prevalent idea that our Scottish
agricultural labourers are a stupid
race. They are shrewd, sagacious,
and intelligent about <em>their own business</em>;
and because they are so, they
are continually being drafted away to
England and Ireland. The employments
of a common ploughman are
various, and of a nature calculated to
cultivate his powers of observation
and of thought. Mr Stephens, after
describing the extent of observation,
of judgment, and of patience, required
in a good ploughman, adds—“To
be so accomplished implies the
possession of talent of no mean order.”—<cite>Book
of the Farm</cite>, vol. i. p. 163.
Talent necessary for a ploughman!
exclaims the incredulous and amazed
citizen, and fancies that the author
must speak ironically. Nay; he never
wrote soberer truth in his lifetime,
and in your ignorance you wonder.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is another reason why not
only the comforts, but why the moral
and intellectual powers of the agricultural
labourer should be cared for.
The common ploughman has committed
to his trust property which, on
a very moderate computation, may be
valued at £100. This property, of a
nature so likely to receive injury from
carelessness and inattention, is daily
in his hands, and under his charge,
and at his mercy. We need scarcely
add, too, how deeply he may in other
respects injure his employer, as, for
instance, by the imperfect ploughing
or careless sowing of a field. To what
common servant, in any sphere of
life, is property so valuable so exclusively
intrusted? It is plain that a
party so confided in, as a ploughman
must be, ought not to have his sense
of responsibility and of moral obligation
blunted and impaired by barbarous
neglect. Hitherto our agricultural
labourers have not occupied themselves
with discussing “the rights of
labour and the duties of capital.” But
if landlords and tenants are resolved
to consider the whole management of
land as a mere matter of commerce,
we cannot see why these operatives
should not be led to philosophise as
well as others. The labourer may
apply in all equity that principle to
his own case which the landlord and
tenant are severally applying to theirs.
The severance between employer and
employed has of late been developed
to an extent never before witnessed
in any age, and it threatens, at this
moment, to throw a terrific chasm
athwart the whole structure of society.
Not only among mill-masters and men,
but among many other classes very
differently circumstanced, have we
witnessed combination and counter-combination,
and their disastrous consequences.
A slight agrarian grumbling
might possibly do good; and,
from all that we can learn, there
is a sulky discontent slumbering in
many an honest fellow’s bosom, that
could easily be fanned, by a skilful
experimenter, into a visible flame.
It will be better, in every respect, to
anticipate and ward off the evil. Its
causes and its cure have been well
expounded by Mr Stuart. But if
our agricultural labourers are too patient
sufferers to complain, too sensible
to imbibe the pestilent doctrines
of Messrs Newton and Cowel, and too
wide apart to have it in their power
to combine, whether for good or for
evil—and if, on these accounts, there
is no ground for alarm, is it wise, is
it kind of you, to take advantage of
their peaceful dispositions, and of their
powerlessness to unite in proclaiming
their wrongs, and in vindicating their
rights? There is a remedy within the
reach of many of them, and of which
they are silently availing themselves.
They can emigrate. They are doing
so quietly, determinedly. They are
not absolutely <i><span lang="la">astricti glebæ</span></i>. The
canker of neglect is eating away the
ties that bind them to their Fatherland.
Multitudes of the best of them
have gone, and thousands would follow
if they had the means. Emigration,
if it proceeds unchecked, will
render “strikes” unnecessary, even
if we are inclined to consider such
things as visionary and impossible
among an agricultural population.</p>

<p class='c010'>They who have not read Mr Stuart’s
appeal, may conclude, from the professed
object of that Association to
which his appeal has conducted, that
he has inculcated nothing more than
the improvement of existing cottages,
and the building of many new ones
more commodious and comfortable.
His philanthropy, however, is more
comprehensive. With an excursive
pen he reviews the whole moral, educational,
and social characteristics of
the agricultural labourer’s condition,
and sketches the remedies for its various
evils. When, therefore, Mr
Stuart merely proposed at the meeting
of the 10th January, as the main
feature of the proposed Association,
the establishment of an office in Edinburgh
for the reception of plans and
models, and improved fittings and furnishings
for cottages, accessible to all
inquirers, it seemed to us, retaining as
we did a delightful reminiscence of his
pamphlet, a most impotent conclusion.
He appeared to have descended from
the high moral arena into the mortar-tub,
and we were in terror lest some
journalist, in a slashing leader, should
cover his scheme with inextinguishable
burlesque. It seemed likewise
a mystery to us how there could be
such extreme difficulty in erecting a
commodious and comfortable cottage,
as that an office in our metropolis
should be required for the exhibition
of right models. It might have looked
that, instead of a labourer’s cottage, it
was a medieval temple of most intricate
composite that was required, and
for the conception of which the genius
of Scottish architecture was unequal
without the aid of unusual patronage.
We feared, too, that the Association
might be described by some malignant
pen as a company of Scottish proprietors
resolving to raise the marketable
value of their estates by adding
to the buildings thereupon. Such
silly caricatures might perhaps have
been anticipated, and in fact some
small sneers were dropped by one or
two of the Radical newspapers; but
the admirable tone of the speeches at
the meeting, when the Association was
formed, seemed for the time to have
stayed the old hatred of the democratic
press towards our landed proprietors.
That our readers may understand
correctly the intentions and
views of “The Association for promoting
improvement in the dwellings
and domestic condition of agricultural
labourers in Scotland,” we recommend
to their perusal the report of
the committee now published, and
which we hope may be widely circulated.
The noblemen and country
gentlemen composing the Association
have combined, <em>not</em> for the purpose
of raising their rentals, but for the
purpose of improving the domestic
condition of the agricultural labourers,
by improving their dwellings. They
have united together for the purpose
of directing attention to the subject,
and of encouraging and aiding others
in removing an evil which they candidly
confess they have hitherto overlooked
and neglected. The evil is of
long standing and of gigantic dimensions,
and it has been felt that the
benevolent zeal and efforts of individuals
required to be concentred into
the potent agency of one national
association, to effect its abatement
and to work out its final extinction.
In the matter of house accommodation
for our agricultural labourers,
while on many estates a very great
deal has been done to improve it, yet
very generally over the kingdom it is
a notorious fact that no improvement
in their dwellings has taken place for
the last half-century. One article of
furniture in the cottages of our Scottish
peasantry has excited the indignation
of all but those who repose
their weary limbs on it—we refer to
the box-bed. The medical faculty
time immemorial have denounced it
as a very “fever case.” Mr Stuart
and his reverend brethren have lamented
the stifling insalubrity of the
formidable structure. Fine ladies and
gentlemen have wondered at the
stupid attachment of the Scottish peasant
to a dormitory so barbarous.
The Duke of Buccleuch has solved
the riddle. He tells us, that when he
ordered the box-bed to be taken out
of the cottage down came the roof!
And thus that which has been the
stay and support of many a tottering
tenement has been most ignorantly
condemned. Nor is this all. So very
damp and cold are too many of the
cottages, that in order to exclude
these evils in some measure by night,
the box-bed is indispensable during
eight months of the year; and we predict
that unless comfortable cottages,
rightly roofed, lathed, and floored are
erected, the box-bed will prove
stronger than Mr Stuart, and will
retain its hold on the affections of the
labourer, upholding at once its own
position and the roof of the dwelling
that affects to shelter it from the
elements. That there is likewise a
lack of cottages in our agricultural
districts is unquestionable. They
have been allowed to decay and disappear,
from economical considerations
entirely delusive, to an extent
extremely prejudicial. The diminished
population of our rural parishes
proves the fact; and if any one will
contrast the census papers of 1841
with those of 1851, which exhibit the
number of the inhabited houses in
the several counties of Scotland, they
will find a demonstration that may
probably startle them. The Association
takes it for granted that an improved
domestic condition will follow
in the wake of improved dwellings
being given to the poor, and no
thoughtful and observing person will
doubt this. It has been beautifully
said, “Between physical and moral
delicacy a connection has been observed,
which, though founded by the
imagination, is far from being imaginary.
Howard and others have remarked
it. It is an antidote against
sloth, and keeps alive the idea of
decent restraint and the habit of circumspection.
Moral purity and physical
are spoken of in the same language;
scarce can you inculcate or
command the one, but some share of
approbation reflects itself upon the
other. In minds in which the least
germ of Christianity has been planted,
this association can scarce fail of having
taken root: scarce a page of Scripture
but recalls it.” It is of the very
essence of every good system to develop
the virtues necessary to its success;
and to the humanising influence
of a comfortable and commodious
cottage, old habits of filthiness and
sloth would gradually yield, and would
every day become a lessening evil.
Such cottages would secure at once
the services of the best class of workmen,
and thus a mercenary self-interest
would find it to its advantage to
follow where benevolence had led the
way. The influence of example upon
the rich, and the influence of superior
house-accommodation upon the social
condition of the poor, must be gradual.
This has been duly contemplated.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is scarcely necessary, we fancy,
to expound this part of the case. It
is now pretty generally understood.
If, however, any of our readers have
not considered this subject, or continue
to entertain some lingering
doubts regarding the effects of improved
house-accommodation upon
the social, sanitary, and moral condition
of the people, we most anxiously
recommend to their perusal Dr Southwood
Smith’s “Results of Sanitary
Improvement, illustrated by the operation
of the metropolitan societies
for improving the dwellings of the industrious
classes, &#38;c.” The pamphlet
costs twopence, and it may take a
quarter of an hour to read it; but
never, we believe, were statistics ever
given to the world so surprising and
so encouraging,—matter at once so
suggestive of deep thought, and so
animating to the aspirations of practical
philanthropy. Lord Shaftesbury
is at present circulating this most
pregnant epitome of the effects of
sanitary improvement among the parochial
boards of Scotland. It is a
most seasonable missive—vindicating
the speculations of Mr Stuart, and
placing on the basis of demonstration
the certainty of the effect of the intended
operations of the Duke of Buccleuch’s
association. The pecuniary
element will be thought our main
difficulty, but we are quite satisfied
that the tendency is to exaggerate it.
Be it remembered that we want no
<i><span lang="fr">cottages ornées</span></i>, and (with your leave,
Mr Stuart) no model bothies, but
merely warm, dry, convenient houses
for honest ploughmen to live in. Let
wealthy proprietors, if they please,
adorn their estates with picturesque
villas, crowned with projecting roofs
and ornamental chimneys; but the
Association over which the Duke of
Buccleuch presides does not desire a
single sixpence to be spent which will
not contribute to the comfort of the
cottage.  The reformatory change
may proceed by degrees, and in no
one year need the outlay be serious;
but on this part of the subject we
refer our readers to the views of Sir
Ralph Anstruther, as contained in his
speech on the 10th January, and more
fully explained in his letter (<cite>Courant</cite>,
January 20th). While the Association
professes, in the mean time (and we
think wisely and judiciously), to limit
its attention to the improvement of
the dwellings of agricultural labourers,
and thereby to raise their domestic
condition, it seems evident that
the basis of its operations may be
easily extended, and that the benevolent
object in view will almost naturally
widen that basis. That object
is to ameliorate the domestic condition
of the labourer; but if other
causes as well as that of improved
house-accommodation will contribute
towards the wished-for amelioration,
these, it may be expected, in due time
will come to be embraced within the
benevolent range of its fostering influence.
To prevent misapprehension
and remove ignorance, we would
respectfully suggest the propriety of
the Association instituting a statistical
inquiry into the physical, moral, and
educational condition of the agricultural
labourers of the kingdom. Such
statistics would form a valuable supplement
to the agricultural statistics
collected under the instruction of Mr
Hall Maxwell. Information seems
necessary to enable the Association
rightly to exercise its influence, even
in improving the dwellings of the poor.
In some parts of the west of Scotland
a sort of mud cottage is raised at an
expense of £3! and a fit model for
one county may be utterly unfit for
another. All requisite information
we believe could be obtained, by addressing
a schedule of inquiry to the
parochial clergy, who are manifestly
ready to lend their aid. In any event,
our landed proprietors cannot well
afford to have more “news from the
farm” thrust upon them by the spontaneous
exertions of volunteer philanthropists.
The public, indeed, seem
to have been infinitely surprised that
our landed proprietors should have
been so ignorant of the condition of
the dwellings and of the circumstances
of the people upon their estates; and
the inference is, that there must have
been something grievously wrong in
the management of their affairs. No
man, of course, can expect that the
proprietor of a large landed estate
should know minutely the condition
of every cottage on it, and the discomforts
of its poor inhabitant. But
the ignorance confessed goes greatly
beyond this. It was surely the more
immediate duty of the tenant-farmer
to have protected his dependants, and
to have represented their disadvantages
to the proprietor. And what
has the factor been doing in the mean
time? General Lindsay, at the meeting
of the 10th January, in a speech
overflowing with admirable feeling,
said, that “the factor was afraid of increasing
his expenditure.” Quite right;
but why was he not afraid, too, of misrepresenting
the kindly feelings of his
constituent towards the industrious
poor upon his estate—of concealing
from him knowledge which, if he
wished to do his duty, it was indispensable
for him to possess—of alienating
from him and his house the love
and veneration of <em>his people</em>—of rendering
his privileges odious now, and
of imperilling his position on any
coming convulsion of the commonwealth?
We have not only now the
evil of non-resident proprietors, but,
in many cases, the evil of non-resident
factors. The door of communication
betwixt landlord and tenant is thus
effectually shut up; and the poor cottager,
who was wont to have access
even to “his honour,” finds things so
altered that an audience with the factor
is become impossible. The accountant
is as ignorant as his constituent
“of the dwellings and domestic
condition of the agricultural
labourers,” and thus there is a complete
abnegation of all the peculiar
duties and responsibilities which Providence
has manifestly laid on the
owners of land. It is impossible to
deny, on the other hand, that very
many of the tenant-farmers, imitating
the manners of their betters, have
become sadly neglectful of the duties
which they owe their dependants.
To give as little and get as much as
he can, is now, in too many cases,
the short and simple rubric of that
code which guides the landlord in his
contract with the tenant. The tenant
extends the principle, and looks upon
the labour of his ploughman as a mere
purchaseable article, that supplements
the deficiency of machinery, and is
necessary to guide the muscular energies
of the horse. With the ploughman,
however, the sale of his labour
is the sale of himself—the devotion
of his sentient nature, with feelings,
affections, sympathies, as lively as
those of his master, and with a pride
and self-esteem as sensitive to unkindness
and wrong. It was in every respect
seemly that the present movement
should originate with the proprietors,
for the house-accommodation
must plainly be given by them; but
now that they have intimated, in so
kind words, their good wishes and
benevolent intentions, we hope the
farmers will consider whether expressions
of “repentance” for the past
are not due from them as well as
from others, and whether works “meet
for repentance” should not instantly
be undertaken by them. Because the
landlord has made his “confession,”
it is conceivable that the tenant may
now fancy that nothing remains but
that he should make a clamorous onset
on the laird for more cottages.
We hope he will not be unreasonable,
but will perceive that he must put his
own shoulder to the work, and be prepared
to make some sacrifices, and to
practice some self-denial. We fear
that some of the tenantry require to
be instructed, stimulated, and watched
in discharging that part of the duty
which falls to them in promoting the
desired reformation. We are quite
of the opinion of the Duke of Buccleuch,
that more cottages should not
be let with the farm than the number
necessary to accommodate the servants
requisite for the work of the
farm. The other cottagers should
rent their holdings immediately from
the landlord.</p>

<p class='c010'>We know no class of workmen who
have so few holidays, and so few opportunities
for rational recreation, as
our ploughmen. They may have the
right to go to some annual feeing-market,
and out of this solitary feast
the poor fellows try naturally to extract
as much pleasure as they can,
turning the day into a carnival of
many-coloured evil. All other classes
of workpeople have their occasional
holiday—their trip by an excursion-train—the
Saturday afternoon, in a
slack season, to see friends and kindred;
but no such pleasures fall
to the ploughman’s lot. In the winter,
indeed, he is on “short time,”
but what is done to make his evening
hours pleasant, profitable, instructive?
In the agricultural world we
shall certainly have no “lock-out,”
and perhaps no “strike,” but it may
be wise, at least, to anticipate possible
contingencies by acts of kindness and
of well-considered indulgence. The
yawning gulf betwixt the high and
the low of the land is the most ominous
evil of these times, and should be
bridged over by sympathetic communication
whilst it can. The wintry
neglect of his superiors is worse to be
borne by the labourer than the cold
of his miserable cottage. Let us listen
to Mr Stuart on an evil which seems
to have entered like iron into his
kindly soul. Addressing landlords,
he says—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let their visits and their smile be
frequently seen in the house of the poorest
cottar, although he be but a hired labourer;
for not fifty years ago, that same
man would have been a crofter, or a small
farmer, waiting on ‘his honour,’ and
welcomed by ‘his honour,’ with his rent
or his bondage. That he is not so now, is
owing more to ‘his honour’s’ change of
customs for his own profit, than to the
cottar’s own fault, or to the profit of the
cottar’s own social position and feelings.
Let there be some upmaking, then, for
this change, so far as such things can be
made up for, not in the shape of money,
but in that which his forefathers valued
much more than money, and which he
will value as highly again, if ‘his honour’
will only but give him time and means
whereby he may recover his self-esteem
and his proper training; and one of the
most powerful and most valued of all these
means would, in a little time, be ‘his
honour’s’ friendly visits to his humble
dwelling.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now that the Scottish people know
that the Duke of Buccleuch finds
time to inquire personally into the condition
of the peasantry on his estates,
no proprietor, however ancient his
lineage and proud his name, will be
excused who fails to go and do likewise,
or who fails at least to acquaint
himself with the condition of the labourers
who cultivate his fields. Personal
inquiry we would recommend,
although it should not lead to the rendering
of one cottage more comfortable
than it was before. We recommend it
for the proprietor’s own behoof. “The
most certain softeners of a man’s moral
skin, and sweeteners of his blood, are,
I am sure, domestic intercourse in a
happy marriage, and <em>intercourse with
the poor</em>,” writes Arnold; and, as if
he had felt the virtue flowing out of
such intercourse, he repeats the thought
thus in another place, “Prayer, and
kindly intercourse with the poor, are
the two great safeguards of spiritual
life.” One-half the world does not
know how the other half lives, and
one-half of the bitternesses of human
life arises from our not understanding
one another. Little do the great ones
of the earth know how much they lose
by avoiding kindly acquaintance with
poor and humble neighbours.</p>

<p class='c010'>We know of no public meeting that
has taken place in our time, where the
speeches delivered possessed a higher
moral value than those that fell from
the speakers at the meeting of the 10th
January last. The turbulent, disrupted,
and gloomy condition of the
manufacturing classes, rendered them
admirably seasonable. They have
shed a benignant influence over the
agricultural community. They have
awakened hopes that were growing
faint, and fine old Scottish feelings
that were dying out, and have proved
a healing anodyne to a wound that
was rankling in many a bosom. The
opening speech of the noble chairman
we have read more than once, and
ever with renewed delight. Many an
honest labourer has read it too, with
glistening eye and joyful heart, and
its perusal has prepared him for fighting
more heroically the battle of his
life. Some of the sentiments of the
noble Duke we cannot withhold from
our columns:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“He thought it would not be disputed
that, generally speaking, throughout
Scotland, the habitations of these labourers
were very defective, especially in those
accommodations for comfort and delicacy.
In former days the farm-servant was accommodated
in the farmer’s house, where
he took his meals, and so was under the
moral control of his employers. But now
the farm-labourer was put into a bothy,
generally a most wretched place to live
in, and often the worst building on the
farm. He could not blink the question
involved in the subject. They had not
come there to bandy compliments to one
another, but to speak the truth. It
might be said to him and those who came
there to find fault with the present system:
You ought to come with clean
hands, and be able to say that all the
bothies on your estate were such as they
ought to be. He confessed with shame
that he could show as bad specimens on
his property as could be found in Scotland.
He would not conceal it that the
condition of many of the cottages on his
estate was as bad as could be. How this
state of things had arisen it was not difficult
to see.... He examined a
number of their cottages himself, and
found many of them quite in a falling-down
state. In one of them, when he
took a box-bed out of it, down came the
roof. Such things would be found not
so very uncommon if these cottages were
looked into. Then what an evil effect
such houses had upon the moral feelings
of those who occupied them! Many of
the persons who lived in them were highly
educated, and it might well be conceived
that a person of refinement living in a
place fit for a pig would be discontented,
as well as unhappy. How could they
expect, when they saw men, women, and
children all living and sleeping in one
apartment, that they could be otherwise
than demoralised? Could they wonder
that all their delicacy of feeling was destroyed?
Mothers had said to him, how
could they bring up their daughters with
respectability when there was not that
separation of rooms which there ought to
be? Then there was a great disinclination
on the part of the tenantry to the
landlord taking these cottages into his
hand. They said they must have every
single thing under their own control. It
was all very well for them to say that as
regarded the lodgment of their domestic
and special farm-servants, but it did not
follow that it was absolutely necessary
that all the cottages of the agricultural
labourers should belong to the farmer.
He did not think that it was right that
the farm-labourer should be bound down
to work for one man only. But the person
who really benefited by the landlord
taking the cottage into his own hands
was the farm-labourer himself; and he
had seen the moral effect produced by
providing better houses for this class of
labourers, in a quarter where thieving and
poaching had formerly been the disgrace
of the people; but since their houses
were improved, there was a great and
beneficial reformation in these respects.
It was really gratifying to see the change
which took place in the feelings of these
people towards their landlord, when they
knew he was taking an interest in their
welfare. Here, when he passed, they
showed they regarded him as their friend,
and were not filled with unpleasant suspicions
about him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gems in the ducal coronet never
emitted a tenderer or more fascinating
ray than when its noble owner entered
the lowly cottage on his mission
of kindness, and since the preceding
sentiments were spoken, we believe
that from many a Scottish heart the
fervent prayer has been sent to heaven’s
gate, that “the good Buccleuch”
may long be spared to his country.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>ALEXANDER SMITH’S POEMS.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c008'><sup>[7]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Some time ago a volume of poems
appeared, over which there arose a
great roar of critical battle, like the
conflict over the dead Valerius, when
“Titus pulled him by the foot, and
Aulus by the head.” Many hailed
the author as a true poet, and prophesied
his coming greatness; others fastened
on obvious defects, and moused
the book like Snug the joiner tearing
Thisbe’s mantle in his character of lion.
Now that the hubbub has subsided,
our still small voice may be heard.</p>

<p class='c010'>The poet in question has at once
deprecated and defied criticism in a
sonnet, (p. 232).</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“There have been vast displays of critic wit</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er those who vainly flutter feeble wings,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor rise an inch ’bove ground,—weak poetlings!</div>
      <div class='line'>And on them to the death men’s brows are knit.</div>
      <div class='line'>Ye men! ye critics! seems’t so very fit</div>
      <div class='line'>They on a storm of Laughter should be blown</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er the world’s edge to Limbo? Be it known,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ye men! ye critics! that beneath the sun</div>
      <div class='line'>The chiefest woe is this,—when all alone,</div>
      <div class='line'>And strong as life, a soul’s great currents run</div>
      <div class='line'>Poesy-ward, like rivers to the sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>But never reach’t. Critic, let that soul moan</div>
      <div class='line'>In its own hell, without a kick from thee.</div>
      <div class='line'>Kind Death, kiss gently, ease this weary one!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Alexander Smith is partly right and
partly wrong. It is true that, throned
in his judicial chair, the critic, more
intent on displaying his own powers
than on doing justice to his subject,
is apt to drop the mild and equal
scales, and brandish the trenchant
glittering sword. He ought to say in
his heart, Peradventure there shall be
found ten fine lines in this book—I will
not destroy it for ten’s sake.</p>

<p class='c010'>But, on the other hand, there is a
class to which forbearance would be
misapplied and criminal. It would
too much resemble our prison discipline,
where Mr William Sykes, after
a long course of outrages on humanity,
is shut up in a palace, treated like
a prodigal son, and presently converted
to Christianity. An absurd monomaniac,
who, like Joanna Southcote,
mistaking a dropsical disorder for the
divine afflatus, and demanding worship
on no better grounds than the
greatness of his own blown conceit,
may, by mere force of impudent pretension,
induce a host of ignorant followers
to have faith in him, ought to
be exposed and ridiculed. Not savagely,
perhaps, for the first offence;
the pantaloons should be loosed with
a paternal hand, and the scourge
mildly applied. If he still persists in
misdoing, it should be laid on till the
blood comes.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Alexander Smith is far from
coming under the latter denomination.
A writer, especially a young writer,
should be judged by his best; and
there is enough excellence in the volume
to cover many more sins than it
contains, though they are numerous.
And while it is a mistake to suppose
that a fine poetic soul, however sensitive,
will “let itself be snuffed out
by an article,” yet there have been
instances where undue severity has
defrauded a writer of his just fame for
many a long year; and though the
critic, in the end, has been compelled
to render up the mesne profits of applause,
yet that is small consolation
for the sense of wrong, and the deprivation
of merited influence and reputation.</p>

<p class='c010'>While foreign writers sketch us as
the most matter-of-fact and pudding-eating
of peoples—while we pique
ourselves on sturdy John Bullism,
and cheerfully accept the portrait of
an absurd old gentleman in a black
coat, and a broad-brimmed hat and
gaiters, with his hands in his well-filled
breeches pockets, as a just impersonation
of the genius of the nation,
it is an obvious fact that a poet
never had such a certainty of being
appreciated in England as now. Fit
audience is no longer few. Let him
sound as high a note as he can for
the life of him, he will yet find echoes
enough to constitute fame. There
are homes in England almost as common
as hothouses, where fine criticism
is nightly conversation—where
appreciators, as true as any who review
in newspapers, hail a good and
great writer as a personal friend.
Here may be found all the elements
necessary for the recognition of merit
and the detection of imposture. Sturdy
good sense refuses to believe in
gaudy pretension; keen logic exposes
emptiness; enthusiastic youth glows
at the high thought, the splendid
image; and the soft feminine nature
responds, with ready tears and unsuppressed
sighings, to all legitimate
appeals to the heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>With such tribunals more plentiful
than county courts, a man is no longer
justified in decrying fame, or appealing
for justice to posterity. It must
be an untoward accident, indeed, that
cheats an author of his due, when so
many are eager to exchange praise
for his fine gold. The demand for
excellence in authorship exceeds the
supply; and there are plenty of keen
readers who, having traversed the
realms of English poesy, yet thirst
for fresh fields and pastures new.
Therefore, if an ardent spirit finds the
world deaf to his utterances, let him
search uncomplainingly for the fault
in his own mind, and never rashly
conclude that for his fondly believed-in
powers of thought and expression
there is, as yet, no sympathetic public.
Especially in poetry is the appetite
of the time unsatisfied; mediocrity,
which should be inadmissible, is indulgently
received, and the poets of
established reputation are on every
shelf. Editions of Shakespeare appear
in perplexing numbers, and the
rusty armour in which a champion for
his text appears, is contended for as if
it were the heaven-forged panoply of
Achilles.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Smith leaves his feelings on the
subject of fame open to doubt. One
might almost fancy him a poet who,
having desired fame too ardently in
his hot youth, had discovered its emptiness
in riper age. A sonnet is devoted
to the depreciation of fame;
whereas Walter, in the Life-drama,
is more than enthusiastic to achieve
it. We have no doubt the ardent
wishes which Mr Smith expresses
through his hero are genuine, and that
the philosophy of the sonnet is a philosophy
he only fancies he has acquired.
Combativeness may inspire
the soldier to achievement, rivalry
the statesman; both may be, in some
measure, indifferent to other fame
than the applause of their contemporaries.
But it is in vain for the poet
to express indifference to the opinion
of the world and of posterity. Why
has he written, except that thoughts
bearing his impress may sound in the
ears of the future, and that the echoes
they arouse may convey to him, in
his silent resting-place, tidings of the
cheerful day, assuring him of a tenure
in the earth he loved, and a lasting
position among the race who were his
brothers? What would not man do
to secure remembrance after death?
For this Erostratus burnt Diana’s
temple; for this the Pyramids were
built, and built in vain; for this kings
have destroyed nations; for this the
care-worn money-getter gives his life
to the founding of a wealthy name;
and if a man may gain it more effectually
by the simple publishing of
thoughts, whose conception was to
him a pleasure, let him be thankful
that what all so ardently desire was
granted to him on such easy terms,
and that he may continue to be a real
presence on this earth, when most of
his contemporaries are as though they
had never been.</p>

<p class='c010'>Taking it for granted, then, that
when a young poet publishes a work
wherein the hero expresses an ardent
desire for fame, the poet is himself
speaking through the character, it will
be interesting to see how he proposes
to achieve it. Mr Smith tells us,
through his hero, that his plan for
immortalising himself is “to set this
age to music.” That, he says, is the
great work before the poet now.</p>

<p class='c010'>To set this age to music!—’tis a
phrase we have heard before of late
years. Never was an age so intent
upon self-glorification as this. Like
the American nation, it spends half its
time looking in the glass; and, like
it, always with the same loudly-expressed
approbation of what the mirror
reveals. It has long been its habit
to talk its own praises, and now they
must be sung. When polkas were
first introduced, many familiar sounds
were parodied, to give character to
tunes of the new measure. Among
these was the Railway-polka, in which
the noise of the wheels and the clatter
of machinery were admirably imitated;
while a startling reality was given
to the whole, by the occasional hoarse
scream of the engine. Now, we fear
that the effort of a poet to set the age
to music would result in something
resembling the railway polka—something
more creditable as a work of ingenuity
than of art, and embodying
more appeals to the sense than to the
heart or the imagination. To him
who stands apart from the rush and
roar, the many voices of the age convey
a mingled sound that would
scarcely seem musical even to the
dreaming ear of a poet.</p>

<p class='c010'>We see the spirit of the middle ages—the
spirit of religious intolerance and
superstitious faith—of deepest earnestness,
and of bigotry springing out of
that earnestness—reflected in Dante’s
page. Spenser shows us the days of
the plume and the spear, when the
beams of chivalry yet gilded the earth,
when the motto of noble youth was—God
and my lady. Another phase of
the same era—the era of romantic
discovery and adventure, when there
were yet fairies on the green, and enchanted
isles in the ocean—reappears
in the works of Shakespeare. Pope has
fixed for ever the time of courtliness,
of external polish and artificial graces—the
time when woman was no more
divine—when Una had degenerated
into Chloe—when love had given place
to intrigue, devotion to foppery, faith
to reasoning; yet a pleasant and
graceful time. And it is no wonder
that the poet, now, feeling that he too
possesses “the vision and the faculty
divine,” should long to leave his name,
not drifting over space, but anchored
firmly on the times he lived in.</p>

<p class='c010'>But none of these old poets went to
work with the deliberate intention of
setting his age to music. Where that,
so far as we can see the meaning of
the phrase, has been done, it is because
the poet lived so much among
the characteristic men and scenes of
his age, that his mind, more impressionable
and more true in its impressions
than others, was imbued with
its spirit, and moulded to its forms; so
that, whatever his mind transmitted
was coloured by those hues, and
swayed by those outlines. The poet
did not hunt about for the characteristics
of his age, and then deliberately
embody them: he chose a congenial
theme when it offered itself, and it,
unconsciously to him, became a picture
of a phase of the time. When
our age, too, is set to music, if ever,
it will be in this way.</p>

<p class='c010'>If ever—For ages of the world, as
worthy of note perchance as this, and
more rich in materials for poetry, have
passed away without being set to music.
Every great change of society,
and of mankind’s opinions, does not
necessarily call for a poet to sing it.
It may be more suitably reproduced
through some other medium than
verse—in newspapers, for instance, or
in advertising vans. Of course, no
man in his senses would say a word
against this age of ours; he could
expect nothing less than to be immediately
bonneted, like an injudicious
elector who has hissed the popular
candidate; yet we would have liked
Alexander Smith to indicate the direction
in which he intends to seek
his materials. Does he see anything
heroic in an ardent desire to secure
ease and comfort at the cost of many
old and once respectable superstitions,
such as honour and duty? Can he
throw over the cotton trade “the light
that never was on sea or shore?” Or,
is popular oratory distinguished by
“thoughts that breathe and words
that burn?” Will the railway station
and the electric telegraph figure picturesquely
in the poet’s dream? Yet,
when the age is set to music, these
chords will be not the most subdued
in the composition. Mr Macaulay said
about as much as could be said for
the spirit of the age, when he drew a
contrast in popular prose between the
present and the past. Had he tried
the subject in poetry, he would have
found the task much less congenial
than when he sung so manfully “how
well Horatius kept the bridge, in the
brave days of old.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Alexander Smith has one characteristic
in common with Tennyson, the
author of <cite>Festus</cite>, and some other
poets of the time. All seem to have
great power in the regions of the
dreary. Their gaiety is spasmodic;
when they smile, ’tis like Patience on
a monument, as if Grief were sitting
opposite. If this is their way of setting
the age to music, ’tis, if most
musical, yet most melancholy. Tennyson,
who possesses the power of
conveying the sentiment of dreariness
beyond most poets that ever lived,
generally selects some suitable subject
for the exercise of it, such as <cite>Mariana
in the Moated Grange</cite>; but Mr Smith’s
hero, and Festus, are miserable from
choice, and revel in their unaccountable
woe, like the character in Peacock’s
novel, whose notion of making
himself agreeable consists in saying,
“Let us all be unhappy together.”
Not thus, O Alexander! sounds the
keynote of the genial soul of a great
poet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Our author’s notion of what constitutes
a crushing affliction is altogether
peculiar. A particular friend of his
hero, after becoming quite blasphemous
because he wanted “to let loose
some music on the world,” and
couldn’t (p. 137), commits suicide on
a mountain, though whether by rope,
razor, or prussic acid, we are not informed.
However, being deranged,
he no doubt received Christian burial.
And Mr Smith, speaking for himself
in the sonnet already quoted, says
that—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>“Beneath the sun</div>
      <div class='line'>The chiefest woe is this—When all alone,</div>
      <div class='line'>And strong as life, a soul’s great currents run</div>
      <div class='line'>Poesy-ward, like rivers to the sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>But never reach it.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The chiefest woe!—the chiefest,
Alexander! Neither Job nor Jeremiah
have enrolled it among human
afflictions. Is there no starvation,
nor pain, nor death in the world?
Is the income-tax repealed? We
appeal from Alexander in travail
of a sonnet, with small hope of safe
delivery, to Alexander in the toothache,
and we are confident he will
change his opinion. Let him look
at Hogarth’s “Distressed Poet,” and
see what it is that moves his sympathy
there. Not the perplexity of the
poor poet himself—that raises only an
irreverent smile—but the poor good
pretty wife raising her household eyes
meekly and wonderingly to the loud
milkwoman, their inexorable creditor—the
piece of meat that was to form
their scanty dinner, abstracted by
the felonious starveling of a cur,—these
touch on deeper woes than the
head-scratching distress of the unproductive
poet.</p>

<p class='c010'>To return to Mr Smith’s idea of
setting the age to music. The first
requisite clearly is, that the musician
shall be pre-eminently a man of the
age. It is at once evident that oldfashioned
people, with any lingering
remnants of the heroic or dark ages
about their ideas, would be quite out
of place here. None but liberals and
progressionists need apply. These are
so plentiful that there will be no difficulty
in finding a great number who
embody the most prominent characteristics
of the time. Having got the
man of the age, a tremendous difficulty
occurs. We are very much
afraid there will not only be nothing
poetical in the cast of his ideas, but
that he will be the embodiment of
everything that is prosaic. Call to
mind, O Alexander! the qualities essential
to a poet—at the same time,
picture to yourself a Man of the Age—and
then fancy what kind of music
you will extract from him. Set the
age to music, quotha! Set the Stocks
to music.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having thus signally failed to point
out how the thing is to be done, we
will tell Alexander how it will not be
done. Not by uttering unmeaning
complaints against Fate and Heaven,
and other names of similar purport
which we will not set down here, like
a dog baying the moon. Not by uttering
profane rant, which, as it would
not have been justified by the mad
despair of a Lear or an Othello, is
horribly nonsensical in the mouth of
a young gentleman who ought to have
taken a blue pill because his liver was
out of order. Not by pouring forth
floods of images and conceits which
afford no perception of the idea their
author would convey. Not by making
the moon and the sea appear in such
a variety of ridiculous characters that
we shall never again stroll by moonlight
on the shore without seeing
something comical in the aspect of
the deep and the heavenly bodies.
Not by——But we have just lighted
on a passage which proves that Mr
Smith knows what is right as well as
anybody can tell him:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>“Yet one word more—</div>
      <div class='line'>Strive for the poet’s crown, but ne’er forget</div>
      <div class='line'>How poor are fancy’s blooms to thoughtful fruits.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>And again—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>“Poet he was not in the larger sense—</div>
      <div class='line'>He could write pearls, but he could never write</div>
      <div class='line'>A poem round and perfect as a star.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>That is the point. Not to dismiss
images unprotected on the world, like
Mr Winkle’s shots—which, we are informed,
were “unfortunate foundlings
cast loose upon society, and billeted
nowhere”—but to mature a worthy
leading idea, waiting, watching, fostering
it till it is full-grown and symmetrical
in its growth; and from
which the lesser ideas and images
shall spring as naturally, necessarily,
and with as excellent effect of adornment,
as leaves from the tree.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whether Alexander can do this,
yet remains to be proved. Some of
the requisites he possesses in a high
degree. Force, picturesqueness of
conception, and musical expression,
all of which he has displayed, will do
great things when giving utterance to
a theme well chosen and well designed;
but at present they only tell us,
like a harp swept by the wind, of the
melodies slumbering in the chords.
Such is the Æolian character of the
Life-drama—fitful, wild, melancholy,
often suggestive of something exquisitely
sweet and graceful, but faint,
fugitive, and incoherent. When our
poet sounds a strain worthy of the
instrument, our pæans shall accompany
and swell the chorus of applause.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sonnets, as conveying tangible
ideas, and such as excite interest and
sympathy, have greatly exalted our
opinion of the poet’s powers. They
have not been much quoted as yet by
any of his discerning admirers, perhaps
because there is little or nothing in
them but what a plain man may understand,
and they contain few allusions
to the ocean or any of the planets.
But here is one showing a fine picture—a
picture that appeals to the
imagination and the heart. It is at
once manly and pathetic, representing
a friendless, but independent and
aspiring genius:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Joy, like a stream, flows through the Christmas streets,</div>
      <div class='line'>But I am sitting in my silent room—</div>
      <div class='line'>Sitting all silent in congenial gloom.</div>
      <div class='line'>To-night, while half the world the other greets</div>
      <div class='line'>With smiles, and grasping hands, and drinks, and meats,</div>
      <div class='line'>I sit and muse on my poetic doom.</div>
      <div class='line'>Like the dim scent within a budded rose,</div>
      <div class='line'>A joy is folded in my heart; and when</div>
      <div class='line'>I think on poets nurtured ’mong the throes,</div>
      <div class='line'>And by the lowly hearths of common men—</div>
      <div class='line'>Think of their works, some song, some swelling ode</div>
      <div class='line'>With gorgeous music glowing to a close,</div>
      <div class='line'>Deep-muffled as the dead-march of a god—</div>
      <div class='line'>My heart is burning to be one of those.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>As Mercutio says, “Is not this
better, now, than groaning? Now
art thou sensible—now art thou Romeo.”
We hope he will be “one of
those,” and think he may. Only he
must believe that, however fine and
rare the poetic faculties he has evinced,
they cannot produce anything for posterity
of themselves, but must build on
a foundation of thought and art.</p>

<p class='c010'>We are afraid, though we have not
descended to verbal criticism, but
have only indicated essential faults,
that Alexander will think we have
treated his book in an irreverent
spirit; but, nevertheless, it is a truly
paternal one. Even in such mood
did we deal, of late, with our own beloved
first-born, heir of his mother’s
charms and his father’s virtues—a
fine, clever fellow, in whom his parents
take immense pride, though we judiciously
conceal it for fear of increasing
the conceit which is already somewhat
conspicuous in his bearing. We rather
think he had been led astray by the
example of that young scoundrel,
Jones, who threatened to hang himself
if his mother didn’t give him five-and-twenty
shillings to pay his score
at the pastry-cook’s, and so terrified
the poor lady into compliance. However
that may be, our offspring,
George, being denied, of late, some
unreasonable requests, straightway
went into sulky heroics—spoke of
himself as an outcast—stalked about
with a gloomy air in dark corners of
the shrubbery with his arms folded—smiled
about twice a-day, in a withering
and savage manner, though his
natural disposition is cheerful and inclined
to fun—and begged to decline
to hold any further intercourse with
his relatives. He kept up the brooding
and injured character with great
consistency (except that he always
came regularly to meals, and eat
them with his customary appetite,
which is a very fine and healthy one),
and was encouraged in it by his
grandmother, who, between ourselves,
reader, is a rather silly old woman,
much given in her youth to maudlin
sentimentalism, and Werterism,
and bad forms of Byronism. She
would take him aside, pat his head,
kiss his cheek, and call him her poor
dear boy, and slip money into his
pocket, which he neither thanked her
for, nor offered to refuse; and he became
more firmly persuaded than ever,
that he was one of the most ill-used
young heroes that ever existed. This
we were sorry to see—like Mrs Quickly,
we cannot abide swaggerers—and
we bethought ourselves of a remedy.
Some parents would have got in a
rage and thrashed him—but he is a
plucky young fellow, and this would
only have caused him to consider
himself a martyr; others would have
mildly reasoned with him—but this
would have given his fault too important
and serious an air, so we treated
him to a little irony and ridicule—caustic,
not contemptuous, and more
comical than spiteful. Just before
beginning this course of treatment, we
happened to overhear him making
love, in the library, to Charlotte Jones
(sister of the before-mentioned admirer
of confectionary), a great, fat,
lymphatic girl, who was spending a
few days with his sisters, and who
has no more sentiment or passion in
her than so much calipee. However,
he seemed to have quite enough for
both, and poured forth his romantic
devotion with a fervid fluency which
I suspect must be the result of practice—for
the young scamp is precocious,
and conceived his first passion,
at the age of nine, for a fine young
woman of four-and-twenty. Charlotte,
working away the while at a
great cabbage-rose, not unlike herself,
which she is embroidering in
worsted, listened to his raptures with
a lethargic calmness contrasting
strongly with the impassioned air of
the youth, who was no doubt ready,
like Walter, Mr Smith’s hero, for the
consideration of a kiss (if the placid
object of his affections would have
consented to such an impropriety), to
“take Death at a flying leap”—which
is undoubtedly the most astonishing
instance of agility on record since the
cow jumped over the moon to the
tune of “Hi, diddle, diddle.” Our
entrance, just as he had got on his
knees, and was going to take her
hand, somewhat disconcerted him;
and we turned the incident to such
advantage, that our very first jest at
him in the presence of the family
caused him (the boy has a fine sense
of humour) to retire precipitately from
the room, for fear he should compromise
his dignity by exploding in
laughter. He strove to preserve his
gloomy demeanour for a day or two;
but finding it of no effect to maintain
a stern scowl on his forehead, while his
mouth expanded in an unwilling grin, he
gave up the attempt; and now greets
any allusion to his former tragedy airs
with as hearty a laugh as anybody.</p>

<p class='c010'>Our impression is very strong that
Mr Smith is not himself satisfied with
his work, and that the undiscriminating
applause he has met with in
some quarters will not deceive him.
He must know that the ornaments of
the Life-drama are out of all proportion
to the framework, and that the latter
is too loosely put together to float
far down the crowded stream of time.
He has a strong leaning to mysticism,
a common vice of the times, and should
therefore exclude carefully all ideas
which he cannot render clear to himself,
and all expressions which fail to
convey his meaning clearly to others.
He should remember that, though a
fine image may be welcomed for its
own sake, yet, as a rule, similes and
images are only admissible as illustrations,
and if they do not render the
parent thought more clear, they render
it more cloudy. His great want
is a proper root-idea, and intelligible
theme which shall command the sympathies
of other minds: these obtained,
he will shake his faults like dewdrops
from his mane; and he will
find that his tropes, thus disciplined,
will not only obtain double force from
their fitness, but will also be intrinsically
finer than the random growths
of accident. It is true that Mr Smith,
through his spokesman, Walter, mentions
a plan for a poem, his “loved
and chosen theme,” (p. 38). He says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I will begin in the oldest—Far in God,</div>
      <div class='line'>When all the ages, and all suns and worlds,</div>
      <div class='line'>And souls of men and angels lay in Him,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like unborn forests in an acorn cup.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A prospect, the mere sketch of which
fills us with concern. If we thought
he would listen, we would say—No,
Mr Smith; don’t begin in the oldest—leave
the “dead eternities” alone,
and don’t let your “first chorus,” on
any account, be “the shouting of the
morning stars.” Rather begin, as
you propose to end, with “silence,”
than in this melancholy way. Let
your thoughts be based on the unalterable
emotions of the heart, not on the
wild driftings of the fancy. Observe
all that strongly appeals to the feelings
of others and of yourself—let art assist
you to select and to combine—your
warm imagination will give life to the
conception, and your powers of fancy
and language will vividly express it.
Don’t set down any odd conceit that
may strike you about the relation of
the sea and the stars, and the moon;
but when you conceive an image
which, besides being fine in itself,
shall bear essential, not accidental,
relation to some part of your theme,
put it by till your main subject, in
its natural expansion, affords it a
fitting place.</p>

<p class='c010'>Following this course, we trust that
Alexander will prove worthy of the
many illustrious scions of the house
of Smith who have distinguished
themselves since Adam, and maintain
its precedence over the houses of
Brown, Jones, and Robinson. Sydney
the Reverend—Horace and James
of the Rejected Addresses—and William,
of the modest and too obscure
dramas (noticed by us before), might
well become prouder of the patronymic
to which they have already lent lustre,
when Alexander, mellowed by time,
and taught by thought and experience,
shall have produced his next
and riper work.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE EPIDEMICS OF THE MIDDLE AGES.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c008'><sup>[8]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This extremely interesting work of
Dr Hecker’s consists of three several
treatises, or historical sketches, published
at different times, and here collected
in a single volume. They are
translated and published under the
direction of the Sydenham Society—a
society which has been the means of
introducing to the medical profession,
and to the English reader, some of the
most eminent works of German physicians
and physiologists. It is seldom,
indeed, that their publications are of
the popular and amusing description
of the one we have selected for notice;
but, speaking of them as a series, they
are of that high philosophic character
which must render them acceptable
to every man of liberal education.
How far they are accessible
to the public at large we have not the
means of knowing, nor whether the
purchase of any single volume is a
practicable matter to a non-subscriber;
but, at all events, means, we think,
ought to be taken to place the whole
series on the shelves of every public
library.</p>

<p class='c010'>The great plague of the fourteenth
century, called in Germany <em>The Black
Death</em>, from the dark spots of fatal
omen which appeared on the bodies
of its victims; the <em>Dancing Mania</em>,
which afterwards broke out both in
Germany and Italy; and the <em>Sweating
Sickness</em>, which had its origin in
England, but extended itself also
widely upon the Continent—these
form the three subjects of Dr Hecker’s
book. The dancing mania, known in
Germany as St John’s or St Vitus’s
Dance, and in Italy as the poison of
the Tarantula or Tarantism, will be
most likely to present us with novel
and curious facts, and we shall
be tempted to linger longest upon
this topic. Readers of all kinds,
whether of Thucydides, or Boccaccio,
or Defoe, are familiar with the phenomena
and events which characterise
a plague, and which bear a great
resemblance to each other in all
periods of history. We shall, therefore,
refrain from dwelling at any
length upon the well-known terrors
of the Great Mortality or the Black
Death.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet the subject is one of undying
interest. The Great Plague is, in
this respect, like the Great Revolution
of France; you may read fifty
histories of it, and pronounce it to be
a topic thoroughly worn out and exhausted;
and yet when the fifty-first
history is put into your hands, the
chance is that you will be led on, and
will read to the very last page with
almost undiminished interest. The
charm is alike in both cases. It is
that our humanity is seen in its moments
of great, if not glorious excitement—of
<em>plenary inspiration</em> of some
kind, though it be of an evil spirit—seen
in moments when all its passions,
good and bad, and the bad
chiefly, stand out revealed in full unfettered
strength. And the history,
in both cases, is of perpetual value
and significance to us. Plagues, as
our own generation can testify, are
no more eradicated or banished from
the cities of mankind than political
revolutions. They read a lesson to
us which, terrible as it is, we are still
slow in learning.</p>

<p class='c010'>We are often haunted with the
dread of over-population. This fear
may perhaps be encountered by another
of a quite opposite description,
when we read that in the fourteenth
century one quarter at least of the
population of the Old World was
swept away in the short space of four
years! Such is the calculation which
Dr Hecker makes, on the best sources
of information within his reach. If
such devastating plagues arise, as our
author thinks, from great physical
causes over which man has no control,
from an atmospheric poison not
traceable to his ignorance or vice,
and which no advancement in science
can prevent or expel, there is indeed
room for an undefined dread of periodical
depopulations, putting to the rout
all human calculations and all human
forethought. But on this point we
have our doubts.</p>

<p class='c010'>“An inquiry into the causes of the
Black Death,” says our author, “will
not be without important results in the
study of the plagues which have visited
the world, although it cannot advance
beyond generalisation without entering
upon a field hitherto uncultivated,
and, to this hour, entirely unknown.
Mighty revolutions in the organism of
the earth, of which we have credible
information, had preceded it. From
China to the Atlantic the foundations
of the earth were shaken—throughout
Asia and Europe the atmosphere was
in commotion, and endangered, by its
baneful influence, both vegetable and
animal life.” When, however, Dr
Hecker proceeds to specify the earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions, and
other terrific events which shook the
foundations of the earth from China
to the Atlantic, we do not find that
the enumeration at all bears out this
general description. A large proportion
of such disastrous phenomena as
he has been able to collect relate to
China; and although the plague
should be proved to have travelled
from the East, it is not traced, as an
identical disease, so far eastward as to
China, and therefore is but vaguely
connected with the great droughts
and violent rains which afflicted that
region of the earth. Nearer at home,
in Europe, we have mention made of
“frequent thunderstorms,” and an
eruption of Ætna, but thunderstorms
and a volcanic eruption have not, on
other occasions, given rise to a plague;
not to add, that if the atmosphere of
Europe was tainted from causes of
this kind, springing from its own soil
and its own climate, it would be quite
superfluous to trace the disease to the
East at all. We should merely say that
a similar disease broke out in different
countries at the same time, demonstrating
some quite cosmical or universal
cause. The most important
fact which is mentioned here, as proving
some wide atmospheric derangement,
is the “thick stinking mist seen
to advance from the East and spread
itself over Italy.” But Dr Hecker himself
adds, that at such a time natural
occurrences would be transformed or
exaggerated into miracles; and we
are quite sure that any really extraordinary
event, occurring simultaneously
with the plague, would, without
further inquiry, be described as
the cause of it. An unusual mist,
just as a comet or any unusual meteor,
appearing at the time, would be
charged with the calamity.</p>

<p class='c010'>On so obscure a subject we have
no desire to advance any dogmatic
opinion. There are facts connected
with this and other great epidemics
which, to men of cautious research,
have seemed to point to some widespreading
poison, some subtle, deleterious
matter diffused through the
air, or some abnormal condition of the
atmosphere itself. Such there may be,
acting either as immediate or predisposing
cause of the disease. But to
our apprehension, all plagues and
pestilences have been bred from two
well-known and sufficient causes—famine
and filth. Scanty and unwholesome
diet first disorders and
debilitates the frame, fevers ensue,
the foul atmosphere of crowded unventilated
dwellings becomes impregnated
by breathings that have passed
through putrid lungs; and thus the
disease, especially in a hot climate,
attains to that malignity that the
stricken wretch, move him where you
will, becomes the centre of infection
to all around him, and from his pestiferous
dwelling there creeps a poison
which invades even the most salubrious
portion of the town; which,
stealing through the garden-gate and
over the flower-beds, enters even into
the very palace itself. Doubtless
other causes may co-operate, as unusual
rains and fogs; the fact that a
murrain amongst cattle sometimes accompanies
or precedes a plague, indicates
local causes of this description;
but the true source of the disease lies
in the city man has built, in his improvidence
or injustice, his ignorance
or his sloth.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is thus that Dr Hecker speaks of
the manner in which the disease may
be propagated, so far as the agency of
man is concerned:—we do not seem
to want any quite cosmical influence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thus much from authentic sources of
the nature of the Black Death. The descriptions
which have been communicated
contain, with a few unimportant exceptions,
all the symptoms of the Oriental
plague, which have been observed in more
modern times. No doubt can obtain on
this point. The facts are placed clearly
before our eyes. We must, however,
bear in mind that this violent disease
does not always appear in the same form;
and that, while the essence of the poison
which it produces, and which is separated
so abundantly from the body of the patient,
remains unchanged, it is proteoform in its
varieties, from the almost imperceptible
vesicle, unaccompanied by fever, which
exists for some time before it extends its
poison inwardly, and then excites fevers
and buboes, to the fatal form in which
carbuncular inflammations fall upon the
most important viscera.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Such was the form which the plague
assumed in the fourteenth century, for the
accompanying chest affection, which appeared
in all the countries whereof we
have received any account, cannot, on a
comparison with similar and familiar
symptoms, be considered as any other than
the inflammation in the lungs of modern
medicine, a disease which at present only
appears sporadically, and owing to a
putrid decomposition of the fluids is probably
combined with hemorrhages from
the vessels of the lungs. Now as every
carbuncle, whether it be cutaneous or internal,
generates in abundance the matter
of contagion which has given rise to it,
so therefore must the breaths of the
affected have been poisonous in this
plague, and on this account its power of
contagion wonderfully increased; wherefore
the opinion appears incontrovertible
that, owing to the accumulated numbers
of the diseased, not only individual chambers
and houses, but whole cities, were infected;
which, moreover, in the middle
ages, were, with few exceptions, <em>narrowly
built, kept in a filthy state, and surrounded
with stagnant ditches</em>. Flight was in consequence
of no avail to the timid; for
some, though they had sedulously avoided
all communication with the diseased and
the suspected, yet their clothes were saturated
with the pestifierous atmosphere,
and every inspiration imparted to them
the seeds of the destructive malady which,
in the greater number of cases, germinated
with but too much fertility. Add
to which the usual propagation of the
plague through clothes, beds, and a
thousand other things to which the pestilential
poison adheres,—a propagation
which, from want of caution, must have
been infinitely multiplied; and since articles
of this kind, removed from the
access of air, not only retain the matter
of contagion for an indefinite period, but
also increase its activity, and engender it
like a living being, frightful ill consequences
followed for many years after the
first fury of the pestilence was passed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It may be worth noticing that Dr
Hecker, or his translator, uses the
terms contagion and infection indiscriminately;
nor is the question entered
into whether the disease is capable
of being propagated by mere contact,
without inhaling the morbific matter,
or becoming inoculated with it through
some puncture in the skin. Dr Hecker
nowhere gives countenance to such a
supposition. The poison would hardly
penetrate by mere touch through a
sound and healthy skin. Such a
belief, however, was likely enough to
prevail at a time when we are told
that “even the eyes of the patient
were considered as sources of contagion,
which had the power of acting
at a distance, whether on account of
their unwonted lustre or the distortion
which they always suffer in
plague, or whether in conformity with
an ancient notion, according to which
the sight was considered as the bearer
of a demoniacal enchantment.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Avignon is here mentioned as the
first city in which the plague broke
out in Europe. We have a report of
it from a contemporary physician,
Guy de Chauliac, a courageous man,
it seems, who “vindicated the honour
of medicine by bidding defiance to
danger, boldly and constantly assisting
the affected, and disdaining the
excuse of his colleagues, who held the
Arabian notion, that medical aid was
unavailing, and that the contagion
justified flight.” The plague appeared
twice in Avignon, first in the year
1348, and twelve years later, in 1360,
“when it returned from Germany.”
On the first occasion it raged chiefly
amongst the poor; on the second
more amongst the higher classes,
destroying a great many children,
whom it had formerly spared, and
but few women. We presume that
on the second occasion the plague
was re-introduced at once amongst
the merchant class of the city, and
this would account for fewer women
falling victims to it, because men of
this class could take precautions for
the safety of their wives and daughters.
But why a greater number of children
should have died, when the
women were comparatively spared, is
what we will make no attempt to
explain.</p>

<p class='c010'>How fatal it proved at Florence,
Boccaccio has recorded. It is from
him we learn with certainty that other
animals besides man were capable of
being infected by the disease—a fact
of no little interest in the history of
the plague. He mentions that he
himself saw two hogs, on the rags of
a person who had died of plague,
after staggering about for a short
time, fall down dead as if they had
taken poison. A multitude of dogs,
cats, fowls, and other domesticated
animals, were, he tells us, fellow-sufferers
with man.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Germany the mortality was not
so great as in Italy, but the disease
assumed the same character. In
France, it is said, many were struck
as if by lightning, and died on the
spot—and this more frequently among
the young and strong than the old.
Throughout England the disease
spread with great rapidity, men
dying in some cases immediately, in
others within twelve hours, or at
latest in two days. Here, as elsewhere,
the inflammatory boils and
buboes were recognised at once as
prognosticating a fatal issue. It first
broke out in the county of Dorset.
Few places seem to have escaped; and
the mortality was so great that contemporary
annalists have reported
(with what degree of accuracy we
cannot say) that throughout the whole
land not more than a tenth part of
the inhabitants had survived.</p>

<p class='c010'>The north of Europe did not escape,
nor did all the snows of Russia protect
her from this invasion. In Norway
the disease broke out in a frightful
manner. Nor was the sea a refuge;
sailors found no safety in their ships;
vessels were seen driving about on
the ocean and drifting on the shore,
whose crews had perished to the last
man.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a terrible history, this of a
plague. Nevertheless, if we were
capable of surveying such events
from an elevated position, where past
and future were revealed to our view,
and the whole scheme of creation unfolded
to our knowledge, we should
doubtless discover that even plagues
and pestilences play their parts for
the welfare and advancement of the
human race. Nor are we without
some glimpses of their utility. Viewing
the matter, in the first place, in a
quite physiological light, let us suppose
that disease has been generated
in a great city, that debilitated parents
give birth to feeble offspring, that the
fever, or whatever it may be, is
wasting the strength of whole classes
of the population, is it not better that
such disease should attain a power
and virulence that will enable it to
sweep off at once a whole infected
generation, men, women, and children,
leaving the population to be replaced
by the healthier who would survive?
would not this be better than to allow
the disease to perpetuate itself indefinitely,
and thus to continue to multiply
from an infected stock? The
poison passes on, and searches out
other neighbourhoods where the like
terrible remedy is needed. Ay, but
it passes, you say, into cities and
districts where no such curative process,
no such restoration of the <em>breed</em>,
was called for. But it is always thus
with the great laws of nature, or of
Providence. Thus far, and no farther!
is said to the pestilence as well as to
the ocean; but the line along the
beach is not kept or measured with
that petty precision which a land-surveyor
would assuredly have suggested.
Man’s greatness arises in part
from this struggle with an external
nature, which threatens from time to
time to overwhelm him. There is,
according to his measurement of
things, a dreadful surplus of power
and activity, both in the organic and
the inorganic world. Nowhere are the
forces of nature exactly graduated to
suit his taste or convenience. Happily
not. Man would sink into the tameness
and insipidity of an Arcadian
shepherd, or the sheep he feeds and
fondles, if every wind that blew were
exactly tempered to his own susceptibility.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the moral effects of plague and
pestilence—what good thing can be
said of them? A general dissoluteness,
an unblushing villany, for the
most part prevails: a few instances
of heroic virtue brighten out above
the corrupted mass. Well, is it nothing,
then, that from time to time our
nature should be fully revealed to us
in its utmost strength for good or for
evil? A very hideous revelation it
may sometimes be, but not the less
salutary on this account. The mask
of hypocrisy is torn off a whole city;
in one moment is revealed to a whole
people what its morality, what its
piety is worth. Of the island of
Cyprus, we are told, that an earthquake
shook its foundations, and was
accompanied by so frightful a hurricane
that the inhabitants, <em>who had
slain their Mahometan slaves</em> in order
that they might not themselves be
subjected by them, fled in dismay in
all directions. Who had slain their
Mahometan slaves! Their Christianity
had brought them thus far on the
road of moral culture! At Lübeck,
the Venice of the North, the wealthy
merchants were not, in this extremity,
unmindful of the safety of their souls;
they spent their last strength in carrying
their treasures to monasteries and
churches. Useless for all other purposes,
their gold would now purchase
heaven. To such intelligent views
of Christianity had they attained!
But the treasure had no longer any
charm for the monks; it might be
infected; and even with them the
thirst for gold was in abeyance.
They shut their gates upon it; yet
still it was cast to them over the
convent walls. “People would not
brook an impediment to the last pious
work to which they were driven by
despair.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Did all desert their post, or belie
their professions? No; far from it.
Amongst other instances, take that of
the Sisters of Charity at the <i><span lang="fr">Hotel
Dieu</span></i>. “Though they lost their lives
evidently from contagion, and their
numbers were several times renewed,
there was still no want of fresh candidates,
who, strangers to the unchristian
fear of death, piously devoted
themselves to their holy calling.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But how cruel had their fears made
the base multitude of Christendom!
They rose against the Jews. They
sought an enemy. The wells were
poisoned; the Jews had poisoned them.
Sordid natures invariably strive to lose
the sense of their own calamity in a
vindictive passion against some supposed
author of it. For this reason
it is, that, whatever the nature of the
public distress may be, they always
fasten it upon some human antagonist,
whom they can have the luxury of
hating and reviling. If they cannot
cure, they can at least revenge themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The noble and the mean fearlessly
bound themselves by an oath to extirpate
the Jews by fire and sword, and to snatch
them from their protectors, of whom the
number was so small, that throughout
all Germany but few places can be mentioned
where these unfortunate people
were not regarded as outlaws, and martyred
and burnt. Solemn summonses
were issued from Berne, to the towns of
Basle, Freyburg, and Strasburg, to pursue
the Jews as prisoners. The burgomasters
and senators, indeed, opposed
this requisition; but in Basle the populace
obliged them to bind themselves by
an oath to burn the Jews, and to forbid
persons of that community from entering
their city for the space of two hundred
years. Upon this all the Jews in Basle,
whose number could not be inconsiderable,
<em>were enclosed in a wooden building,
constructed for the purpose, and burnt together
with it</em>, upon the mere outcry of
the people, without sentence or trial,
which indeed would have availed them
nothing. <em>Soon after the same thing took
place at Freyburg.</em> A regular diet was
held at Bennefeeld, in Alsace, where the
bishops, lords, and barons, as also deputies
of the counties and towns, consulted
how they should proceed with regard to
the Jews: and when the deputies of
Strasburg—not, indeed, the bishop of this
town, who proved himself a violent fanatic—spoke
in favour of the persecuted,
as nothing criminal was substantiated
against them, a great outcry was raised,
and it was vehemently asked why, if so,
they had covered their wells and removed
their buckets?” [The wells were not
used in the mere suspicion that they were
poisoned, and then the covering of them
up became a proof with these reasoners
that they <em>had</em> been poisoned]. “A sanguinary
decree was resolved upon, of
which the populace, who obeyed here the
call of the nobles and superior clergy, became
but the too willing executioners.
Wherever the Jews were not burnt they
were at least banished, and so being
compelled to wander about, they fell
into the hands of the country people, who
without humanity, and regardless of all
laws, persecuted them with fire and
sword. At Spires the Jews, driven to
despair, assembled in their own habitations,
which they set on fire, and thus
consumed themselves with their families.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The atrocities, in short, that were
committed against this unhappy
people were innumerable. At Strasburg
2000 men were burnt in their
own burial-ground. At Mayence,
12,000 are said to have been put to a
cruel death. At Eslingen the whole
Jewish community burned themselves
in their own synagogue. Those whom
the Christians saved they insisted
upon baptising! And, as fanaticism
begets fanaticism, Jewish mothers
were seen throwing their children on
the pile, <em>to prevent their being baptised</em>,
and then precipitating themselves into
the flames. From many of the accused
the rack extorted a confession
of guilt; and as some Christians also
were sentenced to death for poisoning
the wells, Dr Hecker suggests that it
is not improbable the very belief in
the prevalence of the crime had induced
some men of morbid imagination
really to commit it. When a
faith in witchcraft, he observes, was
prevalent, many an old woman was
tempted to mutter spells against her
neighbour. The false accusation had
ended in producing, if not the crime
itself, yet the criminal intention.</p>

<p class='c010'>When we remember what took place
in England under the reign of one
Titus Oates, we shall not conclude
that these terrible hallucinations of the
public mind are proofs of any very
peculiar condition of barbarism. Then,
as at the later epoch to which we have
alluded, a very marvellous plot was
devised and thoroughly credited. All
the Jews throughout Christendom
were under the control and government
of certain superiors at Toledo—a
secret and mysterious council of
Rabbis—from whom they received
their commands. These prepared the
poison with their own hands, from
spiders, owls, and other venomous
animals, and distributed it in little
bags, with injunctions where it was
to be thrown. Dr Hecker gives us,
in an appendix, an official account of
the “Confessions made on the 15th
September, in the year of our Lord
1348, in the castle of Chillon, by the
Jews arrested in Neustadt on the
charge of poisoning the wells, springs,
and other places, also food, &#38;c., with
the design of destroying and extirpating
all Christians.” These confessions
were, of course, produced by
the rack, or by the threat of torture,
and the manifest inutility of any defence
or denial. Nor must it be forgotten,
that the official report was
drawn up <em>after</em> the whole of the Jews
at Neustadt had been burnt on this
very charge. Amongst these confessions
is one of Balaviginus, a Jewish
physician, arrested at Chillon “in
consequence of being found in the
neighbourhood.” He was put for a
short time upon the rack, and, after
being taken down, “confessed, after
much hesitation, that, about ten weeks
before, the Rabbi Jacob of Toledo
sent him, by a Jewish boy, <em>some poison
in the mummy of an egg</em>: it was
a powder sewed up in a thin leathern
pouch, accompanied by a letter, commanding
him, on penalty of excommunication,
and by his required obedience
to the law, to throw the poison
into the larger and more frequented
wells of Thonon.” Similar letters had
been sent to other Jews. All Jews,
indeed, were under the necessity of
obeying these injunctions. He, Balaviginus,
had done so; he had thrown
the poison into several wells. It was
a powder half red and half black. Red
and black spots were produced by the
plague; it was right that this poison
should partake of these two colours.</p>

<p class='c010'>Conveyed over the lake from Chillon
to Clarens to point out the well
into which he had thrown the powder,
Balaviginus, “on being conducted to
the spot, and having seen the well,
acknowledged that to be the place,
saying, ‘This is the well into which I
put the poison.’ The well was examined
in his presence, and the linen
cloth in which the poison had been
wrapped was found. He acknowledged
this to be the linen which had
contained the poison; he described
it as being of two colours—red and
black.” We follow in imagination
this Jewish physician. Taken from
the rack to his cell, he repeats whatever
absurdity his unrelenting persecutors
put into his mouth. Rabbi
Jacob of Toledo—mummy of an egg—what
you will. Conducted to the
well—yes, this was the well; shown
the very rag—yes, this was the rag;—and
the powder? yes, it was red
and black. What scorn and bitterness
must have mingled with the
agony of the Jewish physician!</p>

<p class='c010'>Amidst all this we hear the scourge
and miserable chant of the Flagellants,
stirring up the people to fresh
persecutions, and infecting their minds
with a superstition as terrible as the
vice it pretended to expiate. This
was not, indeed, their first appearance
in Europe; nor did the Flagellants
do more, at the commencement,
than exaggerate the sort of piety their
own church had taught them. Happily,
as their fanaticism rose, they
put themselves in opposition to the
hierarchy, and were thus the sooner
dispersed. In their spiritual exultation
they presumed to reform or to
dispense with the priesthood. They
found themselves, therefore, in their
turn subjected to grave denunciations,
and pronounced to be one cause of
the wrath of Heaven.</p>

<p class='c010'>All this time what were the physicians
doing? In the history of the
plague, written by a physician, the
topic, we may be sure, is not forgotten.
But the information we glean
is of a very scanty, unsatisfactory
character. As to the origin of the
plague—“A grand conjunction of the
three superior planets, Saturn, Jupiter,
and Mars, in the sign of Aquarius,
which took place, according to Guy
de Chauliac, on the 24th March 1345,
was generally received as its principal
cause. In fixing the day, this physician,
who was deeply versed in
astrology, did not agree with others;
wherefore there arose various disputations
of weight in that age, but of
none in ours.” The medical faculty
of Paris pronounced the same opinion.
Being commissioned to report on the
causes and the remedies of this Great
Mortality, they commence thus:
“It is known that in India, and the
vicinity of the Great Sea, the constellations
which emulated the rays of
the sun, and the warmth of the
heavenly fire, exerted their power
especially against that sea, and struggled
violently with its waters.” Hence
vapours and corrupted fogs; hence
no wholesome rain, or hail, or snow,
or dew, could refresh the earth. But
notwithstanding this learning, quite
peculiar to the age, they were not
more at fault than other learned
bodies have been in later times, in
the practical remedies they suggested
against the disease. They were not entirely
occupied in fixing the day when
Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn, had combated
the sun over the great Indian
Ocean. “They did,” as Dr Hecker
says, “what human intellect could do
in the actual condition of the healing
art; and their knowledge of the disease
was by no means despicable.”
When fevers have attained to that
malignancy that they take the name
of plagues, they have escaped, we
suspect, from the control of the physician;—just
as when fires take the
name of conflagrations, you must devote
all your efforts to the saving of
what is yet unconsumed, and checking
the extension of the flames.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amongst the consequences of the
plague, Dr Hecker notices that the
church acquired treasures and large
properties in land, even to a greater
extent than after the Crusades; and
that, on the subsidence of the calamity,
many entered the priesthood,
or flocked to the monasteries, who
had no other motive than to participate
in this wealth. He adds, also,
that,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“After the cessation of the Black
Plague, a greater fecundity in women
was everywhere remarkable—a grand
phenomenon, which, from its occurrence
after every destructive pestilence, proves
to conviction, if any occurrence can do
so, the prevalence of a higher power in
the direction of general organic life.
Marriages were, almost without exception,
prolific, and double and treble
births were more frequent than at other
times; under which head we should remember
the strange remark, that after
the ‘great mortality’ <em>the children were
said to have got fewer teeth than before</em>;
at which contemporaries were mightily
shocked, and even later writers have felt
surprise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If we examine the grounds of this
oft-repeated assertion, we shall find that
they were astonished to see children cut
twenty, or at most twenty-two teeth,
under the supposition that a greater
number had formerly fallen to their
share. Some writers of authority, as, for
example, the physician Savonarola, at
Ferrara, who probably looked for twenty-eight
teeth in children, published their
opinions on this subject. Others copied
from them without seeing for themselves,
as often happens in other matters which
are equally evident; and thus the world
believed in a miracle of an imperfection
in the human body, which had been
caused by the Black Plague.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That a fresh impetus would be
given to population seems to us quite
sufficiently accounted for, without
calling into aid any “higher power
in the direction of general organic
life.” Men and women would marry
early; and the very fact of their having
survived the plague would, in
general, prove that they were healthy
subjects, or had been well and temperately
brought up. There would
be the same impetus to population
that an extensive emigration would
cause, and an emigration that had
carried away most of the sick and
the feeble. The belief that double
and treble births were more frequent
than at other times, may perhaps be
explained in the same manner as the
belief that there were fewer teeth than
before in the human head. No accurate
observations had been at all made
upon the subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>We come next in order to <em>The
Dancing Mania</em>—an epidemic of a
quite different character. Not, indeed,
as the name might imply, that
the convulsive dance was a very
slight affliction—it was felt to be quite
otherwise; but because it belongs to
that class of nervous maladies in
which there is great room for mental
or psychical influence. Such disorders
spring up in a certain condition
of the body, but the form they
assume will depend on social circumstances,
or the ideas current at the
time. And thus Dr Hecker finds no
difficulty in arranging the <i><span lang="fr">Convulsionnaires</span></i>
of France, or the early Methodists
of England and Wales, in the
same category as the maniacal dancers
of Germany. It was in all the
cases a physical tendency of a similar
character, brought out under the influence
of different ideas.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr Hecker mentions a case which,
from the simplicity of the facts,
would form a good introduction to
others of a more complicated character.
In the year 1787, at a cotton-manufactory
at Hodden Bridge, in
Lancashire, a girl put a mouse into
the bosom of another girl, who had a
great dread of mice. It threw her
into a fit, and the fit continued, with
the most violent convulsions, for
twenty-four hours. On the following
day three other girls were seized in
the same way; on the day after six
more. A report was now spread
that a strange disease had been introduced
into the factory by a bag of
cotton opened in the house. Others
who had not even seen the infected,
but only heard of their convulsions,
were seized with the same fits. In
three days, the number of the sufferers
had reached to twenty-four. The
symptoms were, a sense of great
anxiety, strangulation, and very
strong convulsions, which lasted from
one to twenty-four hours, and of so
violent a nature that it required four
or five persons to prevent the patients
from tearing their hair, and dashing
their heads against the floor and
walls. Dr St Clare was sent for from
Preston. Dr St Clare deserves to
have his name remembered. The
ingenious man took with him a portable
electrical machine. The electric
shock cured all his patients without
an exception. When this was known,
and the belief could no longer hold
its ground that the plague had been
brought in by the cotton bag, no
fresh person was affected.</p>

<p class='c010'>If we substitute for the cotton bag
a belief in some demoniacal influence,
compelling people to dance against
their will, we have the dancing
mania of Germany. Unhappily there
was no St Clare at hand, with his
electrical machine, to give a favourable
shock to body and mind at once,
and thus disperse the malady before
it gathered an overpowering strength
by the very numbers of the infected.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The effects of the Black Death,”
writes Dr Hecker (whose account of the
disorder we cannot do better than give,
with some abridgments), “had not yet
subsided, when a strange delusion arose
in Germany. It was a convulsion which
in the most extraordinary manner infuriated
the human frame, and excited the
astonishment of contemporaries for more
than two centuries, since which time it
has never reappeared. It was called the
Dance of St John, or of St Vitus, on
account of the Bacchantic leaps by
which it was characterised, and which
gave to those affected, whilst performing
their wild dance, and screaming and foaming
with fury, all the appearance of persons
possessed. It did not remain confined
to particular localities, but was
propagated by the sight of the sufferers,
like a demoniacal epidemic, over the
whole of Germany and the neighbouring
countries to the north-west, which were
already prepared for its reception by the
prevailing opinions of the times.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So early as the year 1374, assemblages
of men and women were seen at
Aix-la-Chapelle, who had come out of
Germany, and who, united by one common
delusion, exhibited to the public,
both in the streets and in the churches,
the following strange spectacle. They
formed circles hand in hand, and, appearing
to have lost all control over their
senses, continued dancing, regardless of
the bystanders, for hours together, in
wild delirium, until at length they fell
to the ground in a state of exhaustion.
They then complained of extreme oppression,
and groaned as if in the agonies
of death, until they were swathed in
clothes, bound tightly round their waists,
upon which they again recovered, and
remained free from complaint until the
next attack. This practice of swathing
was resorted to on account of the tympany
which followed these spasmodic
ravings; but the bystanders frequently
relieved patients in a less artificial manner,
by thumping or trampling upon the
parts affected. While dancing, they
neither saw nor heard, being insensible
to external impressions through the
senses, but were haunted by visions,
their fancies conjuring up spirits, whose
names they shrieked out; and some of
them afterwards asserted that they felt
as if they had been immersed in a stream
of blood, which obliged them to leap so
high. Others, during the paroxysm, saw
the heavens open, and the Saviour enthroned
with the Virgin Mary, according
as the religious notions of the age were
strangely and variously reflected in their
imaginations.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The disease spread itself in two
directions. It extended from Aix-la-Chapelle
through the towns of the
Netherlands, and also through the
Rhenish towns. In Liege, Utrecht,
and many other towns of Belgium,
the dancers appeared with garlands in
their hair, and their waists already
girt with a cloth or bandage, that
they might receive immediate relief
on the attack of the tympany. It
seems that the crowd around were
often more ready to administer relief
by kicks and blows than by drawing
this bandage tight. The most opposite
feelings seem to have been excited
in the multitude by these exhibitions.
Sometimes an idle and vicious
mob would take advantage of them,
and they became the occasion of much
riot and debauchery. More frequently,
however, the demoniacal origin of the
disease, of which few men doubted,
led to its being regarded with astonishment
and horror. Religious processions
were instituted on its account,
masses and hymns were sung, and
the whole power of the priesthood was
called in to exorcise the evil spirit.
The malady rose to its greatest height
in some of the towns on the Rhine.
At Cologne the number of the possessed
amounted to more than five
hundred, whilst at Metz the streets
are said to have been filled (numbering
women and children together) with
eleven hundred dancers. Even those
idle vagabonds who, for their own
purposes, imitated their convulsive
movements, assisted to spread the
disorder; for in these maladies the
susceptible are infected quite as easily
by the imitation as by the reality.</p>

<p class='c010'>The physicians stood aloof. Acknowledged
as a demoniacal possession,
they left the treatment of the
disease entirely to the priesthood;
and their exorcisms were not without
avail. But it was necessary to this
species of remedy that the patients
should have faith in the church and
its holy ministers. Without faith
there would certainly, in such a case,
be no cure; and, unhappily, the report
had been spread by some irreverend
schismatics that the disorder itself
was owing—to what will our readers
suppose?—to an imperfect baptism—to
the baptism of children by the
hands of unchaste priests. Where
this notion prevailed, the exorcism,
we need not say, was unavailing.</p>

<p class='c010'>The malady first bore the name of
St John’s Dance, afterwards that of
St Vitus’s. This second name it took
from the mere circumstance that St
Vitus was the saint appealed to for
its cure. A legend had been framed
with a curious disregard—even for a
legend—of all history and chronology,
in which St Vitus, who suffered martyrdom,
as the church records, under
the Emperor Domitian, is described
as praying, just before he bent his
neck to the sword, that he might
protect from the Dancing Mania all
those <em>who should solemnise the day of
his commemoration</em>, and fast upon its
eve. The prayer was granted; a
voice from heaven was heard saying,
“Vitus, thy prayer is accepted.”
He became, of course, the patron
saint of those afflicted with the
dancing plague. But the name under
which it first appeared, of St John’s
Dance, receives from Dr Hecker an
explanation which points out to
us a probable origin of the disease
itself, or of the peculiar form which it
assumed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The connection,” he says, “which
John the Baptist had with the dancing
mania of the fourteenth century, was of a
totally different character. He was originally
far from being a protecting saint
to those who were attacked, or one who
would be likely to give them relief from
a malady considered as the work of the
devil. On the contrary, the manner in
which he was worshipped afforded an
important and very evident cause for its
development. From the remotest period,
perhaps even so far back as the fourth
century, St John’s day was solemnised
with all sorts of strange and rude customs,
of which the original mystical
meaning was variously disfigured among
different nations by superadded relics of
heathenism. Thus the Germans transferred
to the festival of St John’s day an
ancient heathen usage—the kindling of
the ‘hodfyr,’ which was forbidden them
by St Boniface; and the belief subsists
even to the present day, that people and
animals that have leaped through these
flames, or their smoke, are protected for a
whole year from fevers and other diseases,
as if by a kind of baptism by fire.
Bacchanalian dances, which have originated
from similar causes among all the
rude nations of the earth, and the wild
extravagancies of a heated imagination,
were the constant accompaniments of
this half-heathen, half-christian festival.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In a note at a subsequent page Dr
Hecker cites some curious passages to
show what in the middle ages took
place at “St John’s fires.” Bones,
horns, and other rubbish were heaped
together to be consumed in smoke,
while persons of all ages danced round
the flames as if they had been possessed.
Others seized burning flambeaus,
and made a circuit of the
fields, in the supposition that they
thereby screened them from danger;
while others again turned a cartwheel,
to represent the retrograde
movement of the sun. The last circumstance
takes back the imagination
to the old primitive worship of the
sun; and perhaps the very fires of St
John might date their history from
those kindled in honour of Baal or
Moloch. Dr Hecker suggests that
mingling with these heathen traditions
or customs a remembrance of the
history of St John’s death—that
dance which occasioned his decapitation—might
also have had its share in
determining the peculiar manner in
which this saint’s day should be observed.
However that may be, as we
find that the first dancers in Aix-la-Chapelle
appeared with St John’s
name in their mouths, the conjecture
is very probable that the wild revels
of St John’s day had given rise, if not
to the disease, yet to the type or form
in which it appeared.</p>

<p class='c010'>At a subsequent period, indeed,
when the disorder had assumed, if we
may so speak, a more settled aspect,
the name of St John was no otherwise
associated with it than the name
of St Vitus. People danced upon
his festival to obtain a cure. And
these periodical dances, while they
relieved the patients, assisted also to
perpetuate the malady. Throughout
the whole of June, we are told, prior
to the festival of St John, many men
felt a disquietude and restlessness
which they were unable to overcome.
They were dejected, timid, and
anxious; wandered about in an unsettled
state, being tormented with
twitching pains, which seized them
suddenly in different parts; they
eagerly expected the eve of St John’s
day, in the confident hope that, by
dancing at the altars of this saint, they
would be freed from all their sufferings.
Nor were they disappointed. By
dancing and raving for three hours
to the utmost scope of their desires,
they obtained peace for the rest of
the year. For a long time, however,
we hear of cases which assumed the
most terrific form. Speaking of a
period which embraced the close of
the fifteenth century, Dr Hecker
says:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“The St Vitus’s dance attacked people
of all stations, <em>especially those who led a
sedentary life</em>, such as shoemakers and
tailors; but even the most robust peasants
abandoned their labours in the
fields, as if they were possessed by evil
spirits; and thus those affected were
seen assembling indiscriminately, from
time to time, at certain appointed places,
and, unless prevented by the lookers-on,
continuing to dance without intermission,
until their very last breath was expended.
Their fury and extravagance of demeanour
so completely deprived them of their
senses, that many of them dashed their
brains out against the walls and corners
of buildings, or rushed headlong into rapid
rivers, where they found a watery
grave. Roaring and foaming as they
were, the bystanders could only succeed
in restraining them by placing benches
and chairs in their way, so that, by the
high leaps they were tempted to take,
their strength might be exhausted.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Music, however, was a still better
resource. It excited, but it hastened
forward the paroxysm, and doubtless
reduced it to some measure and
rhythm. The magistrates even hired
musicians for the purpose of carrying
the dancers the more rapidly through
the attack, and directed that athletic
men should be sent among them, in
order to complete their exhaustion.
A marvellous story is related on the
authority of one Felix Plater: Several
powerful men being commissioned
to dance with a girl who had the
dancing mania till she had recovered
from her disorder, they successively
relieved each other, and danced on
for the space of four weeks! at the
end of which time the patient fell
down exhausted, was carried to an
hospital, and there recovered. She
had never once undressed, was entirely
regardless of the pain of her
lacerated feet, and had merely sat
down occasionally to take some nourishment
or to slumber, and even then
“the hopping movement of her body
continued.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Happily, however, this mania grew
more rare every year, so that in the
beginning of the seventeenth century
we may be said to be losing sight of
it in Germany. Nor shall we follow
out its history further in that country,
because the same disorder, under a
different form, made its appearance
in Italy, and we must by no means
neglect to notice the dancing mania
which was so universally attributed
to the bite of the tarantula. Whatever
part the festival of St John the
Baptist performed in Germany, as an
exciter of the disease, that part was
still more clearly performed in Italy
by the popular belief in the venom of
a spider.</p>

<p class='c010'>We shall not go back with Dr
Hecker into the fears or superstitions
of classical times as to the bite of
certain spiders or lizards; we must
keep more strictly to our text; we
must start from the period when
men’s minds were still open to pain
and alarm on account of the frequent
return of the plague.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The bite of venomous spiders, or
rather the unreasonable fear of its consequences,
excited at such a juncture,
though it could not have done so at an
earlier period, a violent nervous disorder,
which, like St Vitus’s dance in Germany,
spread by sympathy, increasing in severity
as it took a wider range, and still further
extending its ravages from its long continuance.
Thus, from the middle of the
fourteenth century, the furies of <em>The
Dance</em> brandished their scourge over
afflicted mortals; and music, for which
the inhabitants of Italy now probably for
the first time manifested susceptibility
and talent, became capable of exciting
ecstatic attacks in those affected, and
thus furnished the magical means of
exorcising their melancholy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Does the learned doctor insinuate
that the Italians owed their natural
taste for music to this invasion of
Tarantism?</p>

<p class='c011'>“At the close of the fifteenth century
we find that Tarantism had spread beyond
the boundaries of Apulia, and that the
fear of being bitten by venomous spiders
had increased. Nothing short of death
itself was expected from the wound which
these insects inflicted; and if those who
were bitten escaped with their lives, they
were said to be pining away in a desponding
state of lassitude. Many became
weak-sighted or hard of hearing; some
lost the power of speech; and all were insensible
to ordinary causes of excitement.
Nothing but the flute or the cithern
afforded them relief. At the sound of
these instruments they awoke as if by
enchantment, opened their eyes, and moving
slowly at first, according to the measure
of the music, were, as the time
quickened, gradually hurried on to the
most passionate dance. It was generally
observable that country people, <em>who were
rude and ignorant of music, evinced on
these occasions an unusual degree of grace</em>,
as if they had been well practised in
elegant movements of the body; for it is
a peculiarity in nervous disorders of this
kind that the organs of motion are in an
altered condition, and are completely
under the control of the overstrained
spirits.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This increased agility and grace of
movement is by no means to be discredited
by the reader. It is a symptom
which distinguishes one class of
epileptic patients. Some have attributed
it to an over-excitement of the
cerebellum. However that may be,
there are greater wonders than this
contained in our most sober and trustworthy
books on the disorders of the
nervous system. We continue the
account:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Cities and villages alike resounded
throughout the summer season with the
notes of fifes, clarinets, and Turkish
drums; and patients were everywhere to
be met with who looked to dancing as
their only remedy. Alexander ab Alexandro,
who gives this account, saw a
young man in a remote village who was
seized with a violent attack of Tarantism.
He listened with eagerness and a fixed
stare to the sound of a drum, and his
graceful movements gradually became
more and more violent, until his dancing
was converted into a succession of frantic
leaps, which required the utmost exertion
of his whole strength. In the midst
of this overstrained exertion <em>of mind and
body</em> the music suddenly ceased, and he
immediately fell powerless to the ground,
where he lay senseless and motionless
until its magical effect again aroused him
to a renewal of his impassioned performances.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We have put the expression “mind
and body” in italics, because we may
as well take this opportunity to observe,
that although convulsions of
this kind are excited, and assume a
certain form on account of the predominance
of some idea, yet, when
once called forth, they are almost
entirely mechanical in their nature.
Mere animal excitability—what is
called the reflex action, or other
automatic movements quite as little
associated with the immediate operations
of “mind”—carry on the rest of
the process. And it is some consolation
to think that the appearance of
pain and distress which marks convulsive
disorders of all descriptions,
is, for the most part, illusory. The
premonitory symptoms may be very
distressing, but the condition of the
patient, when the fit is on, is that of
insensibility to pain.</p>

<p class='c010'>The general conviction was, that
by music and dancing the poison of
the tarantula was distributed over
the whole body, and expelled through
the skin; but, unfortunately, it was
also believed that if the slightest vestige
of it remained behind the disorder
would break out again. Thus
there was no confidence excited in a
perfect cure. Men who had danced
themselves well one summer watched
the next summer for the returning
symptoms, and found in themselves
what they looked for. Thus—</p>

<p class='c011'>“The number of those affected by it
increased beyond belief, for whoever had
actually been, or even fancied that he
had been once bitten by a poisonous
spider or scorpion, made his appearance
annually whenever the merry notes of
the Tarantella resounded. Inquisitive
females joined the throng and caught the
disease—not indeed from the poison of the
spider, but from the mental poison which
they eagerly received through the eye;
and thus the cure of the <em>Tarantati</em> gradually
became established as a regular
festival of the populace.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was customary for whole bands
of musicians to traverse Italy during
the summer months, and the cure of
the disordered was undertaken on a
grand scale. This season of dancing
and music was called “The women’s
little carnival,” for it was women
more especially who conducted the
arrangements. It was they, too, it
seems, who paid the musicians their
fee. The music itself received its due
share of study and attention. There
were different kinds of the Tarantella
(as the curative melody was called)
suited to every variety of the ailment.</p>

<p class='c010'>One very curious circumstance connected
with this disease must not pass
unnoticed—the passion excited by
certain colours. Amongst the Germans,
those afflicted by St Vitus’s
dance were enraged by any garment
of the colour of red. Amongst the
Italians, on the contrary, red colours
were generally liked. Some preferred
one colour, some another, but the devotion
to the chosen colour was one
of the most extraordinary symptoms
which the disease manifested in Italy.
The colour that pleased the patient
he was enamoured of; the colour that
displeased excited his utmost fury.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some preferred yellow, others were
enraptured with green; and eyewitnesses
describe this rage for colours as so extraordinary
that they can scarcely find words
with which to express their astonishment.
No sooner did the patients obtain
a sight of their favourite colour than
they rushed like infuriated animals towards
the object, devoured it with their
eager looks, kissed and caressed it in every
possible way, and, gradually resigning
themselves to softer sensations, adopted
the languishing expression of enamoured
lovers, and embraced the handkerchief,
or whatever article it might be which
was presented to them, with the most intense
ardour, while the tears streamed
from their eyes as if they were completely
overwhelmed by the inebriating
impression on their senses.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The dancing fits of a certain Capuchin
friar in Tarentum excited so much curiosity
that Cardinal Cajetano proceeded to
the monastery that he might see with his
own eyes what was going on. As soon as the
monk, who was in the midst of his dance,
perceived the spiritual prince clothed in
his red garments, he no longer listened to
the tarantella of the musicians, but with
strange gestures endeavoured to approach
the cardinal, as if he wished to count the
very threads of his scarlet robe, and to
allay his intense longing by its odour.
The interference of the spectators, and
his own respect, prevented his touching
it, and thus, the irritation of his senses
not being appeased, he fell into a state of
such anguish and disquietude that he
presently sunk down in a swoon, from
which he did not recover until the cardinal
compassionately gave him his cape.
This he immediately seized in the greatest
ecstasy, and pressed, now to his breast,
now to his forehead and cheeks, and then
again commenced his dance as if in the
frenzy of a love fit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Another curious symptom, which
was probably connected with this
passion for colour, was an ardent
longing for the sea. These over-susceptible
people were attracted irresistibly
to the boundless expanse of the
blue ocean, and lost themselves in its
contemplation. Some were carried
so far by this vague passionate longing
as to cast themselves into the
waves.</p>

<p class='c010'>The persuasion of the inevitable
and fatal consequences of being bitten
by the tarantula was so general that
it exercised a dominion over the
strongest minds. Men who in their
sober moments considered the disorder
as a species of nervous affection
depending on the imagination, were
themselves brought under the influence
of this imagination, and suffered
from the disorder at the approach of
the dreaded tarantula. A very striking
anecdote of this kind is told of the
Bishop of Foligno. Quite sceptical
as to the venom of the insect, he
allowed himself to be bitten by a
tarantula. But he had not measured
the strength of his own imagination,
however well he had estimated the
real malignancy of the spider. The
bishop fell ill, nor was there any cure
for him but the music and the dance.
Many reverend old gentlemen, it is
said, to whom this remedy appeared
highly derogatory, only exaggerated
their symptoms by delaying to have
recourse to what, after all, was found
to be the true and sole specific.</p>

<p class='c010'>But even popular errors are not
eternal. This of Tarantism continued,
our author tells us, throughout
the whole of the seventeenth century,
but gradually declined till it
became limited to single cases. “It
may therefore be not unreasonably
maintained,” he concludes, “that the
Tarantism of modern times bears
nearly the same relation to the original
malady as the St Vitus’s dance
which still exists, and certainly has
all along existed, bears, in certain
cases, to the original dancing mania
of the dancers of St John.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In a subsequent chapter, our author
informs us that a disease of a similar
character existed in Abyssinia, or still
exists, for the authority he quotes is
that of an English surgeon who resided
nine years in Abyssinia, from
1810 to the year 1819. We cannot
pretend to say that we have ever seen
the book, which the learned German
has, however, not permitted to escape
him—we have never seen the <cite>Life
and Adventures of Nathaniel Pearce</cite>,
written by himself; but, judging by
the extract here given, Nathaniel
Pearce must be a person worth knowing,
he writes with so much candour
and simplicity. The disease is called
in Abyssinia the Tigretier, because it
occurs most frequently in the Tigrè
country. The first remedy resorted
to is the introduction of a learned
Dofter, “who reads the Gospel of St
John, and drenches the patient with
cold water daily.” If this does not
answer, then the relations hire a band
of trumpeters, drummers, and fifers,
and buy a quantity of liquor; all the
young men and women of the place
assemble at the patient’s house, and
she (for it is generally a woman), arrayed
in all the finery and trinkets
that can be borrowed from the neighbours,
is excited by the music to
dance, day after day if necessary, till
she drops down from utter exhaustion.
The disease is attended with a great
emaciation; and the doctor says “he
was almost alarmed to see one nearly
a skeleton move with such strength.”
He then proceeds to recount his own
domestic calamity in a strain of the
most commendable candour:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I could not have ventured to write
this from hearsay, nor could I conceive
it possible until I was obliged to put this
remedy in practice upon my own wife,
who was seized with the same disorder.
I at first thought that a whip would be
of some service, and one day attempted
a few strokes when unnoticed by any
person, <em>we being by ourselves</em>, and I having
a strong suspicion that this ailment
sprang from the weak minds of women,
who were encouraged in it for the sake
of the grandeur, rich dress, and music
which accompany the cure. But how
much was I surprised, the moment I
struck a light blow, thinking to do good,
to find that she became like a corpse;
and even the joints of her fingers became
so stiff that I could not straighten them.
Indeed, I really thought that she was
dead, and immediately made it known to
the people in the house that she had
fainted, but did not tell them the cause;
upon which they immediately brought
music, which I had for many days denied
them, and which soon revived her; and
I then left the house to her relations, to
cure her at my expense. One day I went
privately with a companion to see my
wife dance, and kept at a short distance,
as I was ashamed to go near the crowd.
In looking steadfastly upon her, while
dancing or jumping, more like a deer
than a human being, I said that it certainly
was not my wife; at which my
companion burst into a fit of laughter,
from which he could scarcely refrain all
the way home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The capability of sustaining the
most violent exercise, for a long time
together, and on very little food, is
not one of the least perplexities attendant
upon these nervous or epileptic
diseases. The partial suspension of
sensation and volition, by sparing the
brain, may have something to do with
it. But into scientific perplexities of
this kind we cannot now enter. One
plain and homely caution is derivable
from all these histories. Good sense
is a great preservative of health. Do
not voluntarily make a fool of yourself,
or your folly may become in turn
the master of your reason. Epilepsy
has been brought on by the simulation
of epilepsy. We doubt not that a
man might dance to his own shadow,
and talk to it, as it danced before him
on the wall, till he drove himself into
a complete frenzy. A sect in America
thought fit to introduce certain
grimaces, laughing, weeping, and the
like, into their public service. It was
not long before their grimaces, in
some of their numbers, became involuntary;
the muscles of the face had
escaped the control of the will. A
decided <em>tongue-mania</em> was exhibited
a short time amongst the Irvingites.
Happily, in the present state of society,
men’s minds are called off into so
many directions, that a predominant
idea of this kind has little chance of
establishing itself in that tyrannous
manner which we have seen possible in
the middle ages. But it is better not to
play with edged tools. If people will
stand round a table, fixing their
minds on one idea—that a certain
mysterious influence will pass through
their fingers to move the table—they
will lose, for a time, the voluntary
command over their own fingers,
which will exert themselves without
any volition or consciousness on their
part. They are entering, in fact, into
that state which, in the olden time,
was considered a demoniacal possession;
so that, speaking from this
point of view, one may truly say that
“Satan does turn the table,” but it is
by entering into the table-turner.
When we have been asked whether
there is <em>anything</em> in mesmerism, we
have always answered—a great deal
more than you ought, without medical
advice, to make trial of. Nor do we
at all admire the performance of the
so-called electro-biologist. Experiments
in the interest of science are
permissible; but is it fit that any one
should practise the art of inducing a
temporary state of idiocy in persons
of weak or susceptible nerves, for the
purpose of collecting a crowd, and
passing round the hat?</p>

<p class='c010'>The subject of the third treatise of
Dr Hecker is the <em>Sweating Sickness</em>.
This third part is more miscellaneous
than its predecessors, and we have no
space to do justice to its varied and
sometimes disputable matter. Dr
Hecker describes the sweating sickness
as a legacy left us by the civil
wars of York and Lancaster. It first
developed itself in Richmond’s army,
which had been collected from abroad,
over-fatigued by long marches in a
very damp season, and probably ill
supplied with rations. Its rapid extension
through the cities he attributes
to the intemperance of the English,
to their overfeeding, and the want of
cleanliness in their houses. Gluttony,
and the filth of the rush-covered floors,
he detects even amongst the wealthiest
of the land. For a minute description
of the disease, and the Doctor’s
investigation into the nature of it, we
must refer to the book itself.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the physicians, and the manner
in which they addressed themselves
to the encounter of this strange calamity,
there is a passage which it may
be instructive to peruse:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“The physicians could do little or
nothing for the people in this extremity.
They are nowhere alluded to throughout
this epidemic, and even those who might
have come forward to succour their fellow-citizen,
had fallen into the errors of
Galen, and their dialectic minds sank
under this appalling phenomenon. This
holds good even of the famous Thomas
Linacre, subsequently physician in ordinary
to two monarchs, and founder of
the College of Physicians in 1518. In
the prime of his youth he had been an
eyewitness of the events at Oxford, and
survived even the second and third eruption
of the sweating sickness; but in
none of his writings do we find a single
word respecting this disease, which is of
such permanent importance. In fact, the
restorers of the medical science of ancient
Greece, who were followed by all the
most enlightened men in Europe, with
the single exception of Linacre, occupied
themselves rather with the ancient terms
of art than with actual observation, and
in their critical researches overlooked the
important events that were passing before
their eyes. This reminds us of the later
Greek physicians, who for four hundred
years paid no attention to the smallpox,
because they could find no description of
it in the immortal works of Galen!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Who shall say, in reading such
passages, that the <cite>New Philosophy</cite> of
Bacon, which reads now like old common-sense,
was not sadly wanted, if
the learned physician, while feeling
his patient’s pulse, could see only with
the eyes of Galen? In the fourteenth
century we see the physician busied
with his astrology, and laboriously
fixing the day when Saturn, Jupiter,
and Mars, did battle with the sun
over the great Indian Ocean; in the
sixteenth we find him, with quite
dialectic mind, absorbed in the study
of his classical authorities; at the
present time we may truly say that
there are no inquiries conducted with
a more philosophical spirit, or with
greater zeal and energy, than those
which relate to the human frame, its
functions and its diseases. The extreme
complexity of the subject renders
our progress slow. And yet progress
can hardly be said to have been slow.
Let any one take up that admirable
little manual on <cite>The Nervous System</cite>,
by Dr Herbert Mayo, and compare it
with any work a hundred years old:
it is a new science; and that not only
from the new facts which a Robert
Bell and a Marshall Hall, and other
distinguished men in France and
Germany, have added to our knowledge,
but from the fine spirit of philosophical
inquiry which presides over
the whole. We have not only left
astrology behind, we have not only
left behind the undue reverence to classical
authority, but we have thrown
aside that dislike and depreciation of
physiology which the metaphysician
had done his part to encourage, and
have entered, as with a fresh eye and
a beating heart, upon the study of the
wonders of the human frame.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE NEW REFORM BILL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We feel compelled to address ourselves
to an ungracious and disagreeable
task. At this moment but one
thought ought to be encouraged
throughout the British empire—that
of encountering and beating back the
new and formidable aggressor on the
liberties of Europe. We shall not
enter now upon the history of past
transactions. We shall not stop to
inquire whether the Ministry acted
foolishly or not in allowing themselves,
in spite of repeated warnings
and most pregnant instances, to be
deceived, cajoled, and outwitted by
the agents of Russian diplomacy. It
is enough for us that the war has, to
all intents and purposes, begun—that
we are sending forth our armaments
and making our preparations for such
a struggle as has not been known
during the lifetime of the present generation—and
that we have, directly,
the most colossal force in Europe to
cope with, to which possibly may be
united a central power of the Continent,
with an army at its disposal more
than twice as numerous as our own.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gladly do we hail the spirit which
at present animates the nation. It
assures us that we have not degenerated
during the long period of peace
which we have enjoyed. It shows
that we are still alive to our dignity
as a people, to our duty as the enemies
of outrage and aggression—that we
have heart enough and will enough,
at any sacrifice, to maintain our high
position—and that the love of Mammon
has not so occupied our souls as
to render us insensible to the part
which we are bound to take, as the
freest state and most advanced community
in Europe. We deny, on the
part of the people of Great Britain,
that they have either been rash or
headstrong in this matter; they have
submitted, with remarkable patience,
to negotiations protracted beyond
hope, and with advantage to the
enemy; and, so far from being precipitate
or impetuous towards war, they
have urged nothing upon the Ministry
until, after unparalleled vacillation,
the latter have been compelled to see
that no other course was open to
them but a final rupture with Russia.</p>

<p class='c010'>This session of Parliament began
as leisurely and lazily as though there
were no combustible elements visible
in Europe—as though there had been
no aggression—as though no severe
blow had been struck by Russia at
Turkey, almost in the presence of and
in defiance of our fleet. Had we been
at peace with all the world, Ministers
could not have shown less symptoms
of excitement. The meeting of Parliament
was postponed to the last day;
possibly on account of negotiations
still pending, after Wallachia and
Moldavia had been occupied by the
Russian troops—after engagements
had taken place upon the Danube—and
after a Turkish fleet had been
assailed and annihilated within the
Turkish harbour of Sinope. Negotiation
is long-lived. The Premier has
even now such faith in protocols that
he professes to believe the peace of
Europe maybe preserved—an opinion,
the gallantry of which cannot be questioned,
inasmuch as he stands alone;
and for which he will certainly be
entitled to immortal credit, if the
Czar chooses to yield and withdraw
after all that has taken place. But
with Lord Aberdeen’s opinions or convictions
we have nothing, at the present
moment, to do. We think that,
considering the important nature of
the crisis, and the vastness of the interests
at stake, it was the duty of
Ministers to have advised an earlier
meeting of Parliament, so that the
natural anxiety of the nation might
not be prolonged, nor any feeling of
distrust engendered. Such a step
would at all events have been satisfactory
to the public, as an implied
assurance that it was intended to
obliterate, by a decided course of
action, the memory of the apathetic
indifference and vacillating policy of
the latter half of the bygone year.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pass we from that, however, to the
actual meeting of Parliament. No
sooner were the members assembled,
and, as it were, shaken into their
places, than Lord John Russell, a
Cabinet Minister, announced that it
was his intention to move for leave to
bring in a bill for amending the representation
of the country; and, notwithstanding
the urgent dissuasions
both of friend and foe, grounded upon
the exceeding impolicy, under present
circumstances, of forcing on a measure
for which there has been no call
or necessity, he, on the evening of the
13th February, proceeded to develop
his scheme.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, it is perfectly true that, in the
course of last session, Lord John Russell,
and, if we mistake not, Lord
Aberdeen, stated that it was the intention
of Ministers to bring forward
some measure of the kind. It is true
also that the former seems resolved,
with characteristic obstinacy, to effect
some great change in the representation,
and that his resolution is not of
yesterday’s date; for in 1852, just
two years ago, he obtained leave to
bring in a bill for the same object, but
with provisions and machinery entirely
different from this. It is not our
intention in the present paper to compare
the two schemes propounded by
this consistent statesman for amending
the representation. Whether,
however, the present bill is insisted
on or not, we certainly shall take an
opportunity of instituting such a comparison,
were it merely for the purpose
of exposing, beyond the possibility
of refutation or defence, the
reckless, inconsistent, and almost crazy
tamperings of the noble Lord with the
fabric of our constitution. We shall
not judge him by any other test than
his own words and his own measures.
He must either admit—and we shall
challenge his warmest adherent or
advocate to deny this—that he regards
the British constitution as something
that may be altered and adjusted to
suit special circumstances and party
ends; or that, in 1852, he, then
First Minister of the Crown, introduced,
with culpable want of consideration,
a measure, the details of which
he now repudiates. It has been the
fashion, on the strength of a flippant
saying of the late Sydney Smith, to
talk of Lord John Russell as a man
adequate, in his own conceit, to the
conduct of any affair or enterprise,
and rigidly and unalterably wedded
to his own opinions. We cannot give
him even that dubious credit now. He
either committed a gross blunder in
his former bill, which is no slight imputation
upon the judgment of a
Prime Minister, or he is acting just
now under the direct dictation of others.
Nothing has occurred, during the last
two years, to make the Reform Bill of
1854 totally and entirely different,
not only in details, but in principle,
from that which was proposed in 1852;
and yet the new measure is utterly
inconsistent with the older one. We
all remember that, in 1852, Lord John
failed to engage the public support—can
it be that he is now playing the
bad and unpatriotic game of which he
was formerly suspected—that he is
bidding for popularity and party
power, irrespective altogether of the
true interests of the country?</p>

<p class='c010'>That comparison, however, we shall
reserve for a future article. We have
said already that it was intimated last
session, on the part of the Ministry,
that a bill for amending the representation
would be introduced. The
question now is, whether it is for the
advantage of the country that such a
resolution should be adhered to. That
Ministers ought to keep faith with the
public is a proposition which we shall
never question. If it can be shown
that the public, in any proper sense of
the term, has become aware of the
existence of a grievance, and has demanded
a remedy or relief; and if,
therefore, Ministers, toward the end
of a session, have admitted the justness
of the demand, but have been
necessitated to postpone the remedy,
they are certainly, under ordinary
circumstances, bound to come forward
and redeem their pledge. But, even
in such a case as that which we have
supposed, when non-fulfilment of the
pledge would naturally create dissatisfaction,
circumstances may arise
to justify Ministers in declining, on
public grounds, to pursue a line of
action which otherwise they would
willingly adopt. The present is not
even a case of that kind. There was
no demand at all upon the part of the
nation for any immediate measure of
reform of representation; and although,
beyond all question, there are
serious points yet to be settled—for
example, the relative representation
of Scotland as compared with England—Ministers
were not urged to undertake
any specific measure, and the
responsibility of having done so must
rest entirely on themselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>But we ask, in the name of common
sense, is this a time to breed dissension
in the country? Set aside such
matters as this, which are not clamoured
for in any way, and there is
absolutely no party feeling among us.
All that has been absorbed in the
national and British feeling; and we
are now sending forth our navy and
our army—parting with our sons and
our brothers—not knowing whether
they may again return to us, but
believing that they have gone to support
a just cause, and knowing that,
in the worst event, they will be
mourned by more than ourselves.
We shall be called upon, and we are
ready, one and all, to submit to increased
taxation, and to perform the
part which our fathers performed when
the integrity of the land was threatened.
But is it the part of Ministers,
<em>now</em>, at the very opening of the campaign,
to do all in their power to excite
angry feelings among us, to awake
party jealousies, and to rouse antagonism
between town and country?</p>

<p class='c010'>In England, the proposed disfranchisement
of nineteen boroughs, returning
twenty-nine members, and the
reduction of thirty-three others, now
returning two, to one member each,
will, beyond all question, excite a vast
deal of animosity and discussion. We
are not by any means so bigotted or
besotted in our admiration of the present
system as to deny that a plausible
argument maybe maintained in favour
of much of this disfranchisement and
reduction; for the old Reform Act was
eminently a party measure, and dealt
tenderly with existing interests whenever
these belonged to the Whigs.
But when we look to the simple facts,
that our system and arrangements
for the distribution of the franchise,
such as they are, stood the triumphant
test of 1848, when every other
state in Europe was rocking before
the whirlwind of revolution—and that
no clamour has been heard for their
alteration—we humbly venture to
think that this is not the time for any
extensive experiment. Nor are we
by any means convinced that the
suppression of small constituencies in
favour of larger ones which are already
represented, would be a practical
improvement. We would much
rather see large existing constituencies
subdivided, so that no elector
should be allowed to vote for more
than one member. This might very
easily be effected. Edinburgh, for
example, would still return two members,
but these would be elected by
two distinct bodies of voters in different
wards. In like manner, where
there are two or more members for a
county, these should be returned by
separate votes in three departments
or districts of parishes, which, indeed,
would be simply an extension of the
system now followed in the larger
English counties. This would at once
supersede the necessity of having recourse
to such ridiculous and fantastic
devices as “the representation of
minorities,” which is contemplated
by the present bill, and which is
grossly unfair, inasmuch as its operation
is only practicable in the case of
constituencies returning three members.
From what we have seen of
their working, we are not at all enamoured
of large constituencies. They
have at present more power than
they are entitled to; for we maintain
it to be contrary to the just principle
of representation that any elector
should have more than one representative.
If the other system, which
Lord John Russell practically advocates,
is a good one, why should not
the three Ridings of Yorkshire be
united, so that electors in the county
might vote for six representatives?
It is just as easy to divide a town as
a county. The machinery is already
supplied by the municipal arrangements;
and if that system were to be
adopted—and we earnestly recommend
it for consideration—we should
hear nothing more of the tyranny of
majorities. Until some such plan,
founded on principle and recommended
by reason, is matured, we
oppose the disfranchisement of any
of the boroughs. But let us again
revert to the time which has been
selected for propounding these sweeping
changes.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have been told, in ridiculously
pompous language, that Great Britain
will present a magnificent spectacle
to the world, if, while engaging
in a deadly struggle with the most
colossal power of Europe, she applies
herself, at the same time, to the remodelment
of her own constitution.
With all deference to the speaker, we
never listened to more atrocious nonsense.
What should we think of the
sanity of the man who, at the very
moment when his house was attacked
from without, should set fire to
it within, for the purpose of exhibiting
the “sublime spectacle” of simultaneous
external defence and internal
extinguishment? Of course we
should consider him as mad, clap a
blister on his head, and have him instantly
conveyed to bedlam. And
yet that is, just now, the precise language
of Ministers. We really are
surprised that any of them should
have the audacity to hazard such an
argument; if, indeed, that can be
called an argument which is no better
than a preposterous hyperbole. They
know, perfectly well, that this measure
of theirs cannot be persevered in without
exciting very general dissatisfaction
in various parts of the country—that
it must necessarily lead to protracted
discussion, and a strong demonstration
of party feeling in both
Houses of Parliament; that if they are
unsuccessful in carrying it through,
they will have weakened their own
influence at a time when it is most desirable
that the hands of Government
should be strengthened; and that if,
on the contrary, they are successful,
an immediate dissolution of Parliament,
and new general election, must
take place. These are the obvious
and inevitable consequences, if they
persist in their present course; and
we hesitate not to say that faction,
in its worst spirit, could devise no
more dangerous scheme for disturbing
the unanimity of the country. “But,”
say some of the Whig and Liberal journals,
“it is obvious that the present
move is a mere indication of what may
take place hereafter. Lord John
Russell has no serious intention of
pushing through this bill at the present
time, nor would his colleagues
permit him to do so—this is merely to
be regarded as the fulfilment of his
pledge, and in due time it will be
withdrawn.” If we are to take that
as the true interpretation of the business—if
we are to suppose that this
measure has been introduced as a
sham, without serious intentions of
carrying it into execution, the sooner
Lord John Russell retires from public
life the better for his own reputation.
Sham bills, we are aware, are not novelties.
Of late years we have seen,
with infinite sorrow and disgust, this
species of deception practised upon
the public, but never at such a time
and under such circumstances as now.
It is no valid excuse to say that this
is the mere redemption of a pledge,
and that Lord John Russell could not
act otherwise with honour. What is
Lord John Russell, that considerations
personal to him should be allowed
to disturb the unanimity of the British
people at such a crisis; or that his
gratuitous pledges and random promises
should interfere with the public
weal? If such a step, in such a juncture,
had been taken by a Tory instead
of a Whig minister, the offence would
not have been allowed, even on the
first night, to pass without a storm
of reprobation. Lord John himself
would have risen, with an unblushing
front, and a total disregard of
antecedents, to prove from Whig tradition
that any attempt to divide the
country, at the moment when it was
collecting its energies for action, was
a crime worthy of impeachment. Mr
Macaulay would have been hurried
from his books at the Albany to explain,
in sonorous language, what
course would have been taken by the
Roman senate, in regard to any one
who might have proposed, when the
Gauls were at the gate, to undermine
the Roman constitution; and the Tarpeian
rock would, doubtless, have been
suggested as the proper punishment.
Sir James Graham would have started
up to protest that this was not the
time for “pottering” over constitutions,
or revising constituencies, and
have insulted the parent of the bill
with the imperious airs of a Commodore
Trunnion. Sir Charles Wood—but
we shall not pursue the imaginary
case further, because the name we
have last cited is suggestive of a counting-out.
What we mean to convey
is, that the political changes contemplated
by this bill, without reference
to minor details, such as lowering
of the franchise, &#38;c., are so serious,
that the Ministry, if they really
intend, or intended, to carry them
through, could not, by possibility, have
selected a worse or more injudicious
time; and that they are, by persevering,
abusing the confidence of the
country. If, on the contrary, this
measure is to be regarded as a sham,
or merely tentatory, then we say that
the country has excellent reason for
feeling indignant and disgusted that,
under present circumstances, such a
hoax should be practised upon it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lord John Russell is unfortunate in
his experiences. By accident rather
than by choice—for he was then no
eminent political character—his was
the hand to open the floodgates more
than twenty years ago. He heard
the roaring of the pent-up waters,
pouring down as if in jubilee, and his
soul was big with triumph. Since
then, he has heard nothing of the
kind; but still his memory lingers on
the far-off Niagara roll, and he wishes,
before he dies, to have the sound repeated.
Hence he is perpetually
prowling about the locks of the constitution,
devising schemes for another
flood, just as the schoolboy, who has
assisted at the sluicing of one dam, is
energetic for a repetition of the experiment,
regardless altogether of the
havoc he may be making below. His
Nemesis—as it is the fashion now to
call it—has been more decided and
humiliating than that of any public
man of our age. He has sunk from
a Premier to a subordinate, under the
command of a chief to whom, for the
better part of his life, he was diametrically
opposed in politics. He was
not even allowed to remain long as a
recognised subordinate. He descended
to the rank of an attaché, in which
situation he now remains. He has
affected partial retirement from politics,
but, at best, he is only half a
Cincinnatus. We do not know accurately
what were the farming capabilities
of the conqueror of the Volsci;
but we know, accurately enough, what
are the literary achievements of Lord
John Russell. We regret, very sincerely,
that he has not been able to
establish for himself a name in letters;
because, if he had done so, we might
have hoped to get rid of him as a politician.
But that remorseless public,
upon whose fiat all authors and editors
are dependent, stood in the way;
and decreasing sales bore a lamentable
evidence to the noble Lord’s decreasing
literary popularity. In order,
if possible, to redeem his reputation,
he touched, with doubtful gallantry,
the shield of the most aged antagonist
in the lists; and the result was
that, like the Admiral Guarinos in
the Spanish ballad, the old warrior—though
in bad case and wretchedly
battered armour—spurred out, and
overthrew him in a canter. Nettled
at this discomfiture, he comes back
to politics; and—availing himself
of his position, which the Premier
cannot well gainsay, inasmuch as
he has no sure hold on the affections
of the leading Whigs, who
would pitch him over, if an opportunity
were afforded, as freely as ever
hencoop was given to the waves—he
propounds a project of further reform,
for which, we doubt not, he is frightfully
objurgated by some of his associates
in the Cabinet. But, let them
say their worst, he knows that he is
still in power—that he can threaten
them, in one way or another, with
active opposition—and therefore they
are constrained to let him appear as
the author of a new Reform Bill; and
although in their hearts they curse
his recklessness, they dare not, in as
many words, repudiate his false position.
Such are the national advantages
and inevitable results of that
species of combination known as a
“Coalition Ministry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Let us now see what changes are
to be made in the electoral body.
These are various and complicated,
but we shall state them in order;
and first, as to the new qualifications.
The following are to be entitled to enrolment,
either in town or country:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1.</dt>
    <dd>All persons having salaries of £100 a-year, derived from public or private employment, 
    provided they are paid by the half-year or quarter.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.</dt>
    <dd>All persons in receipt of £10 a-year, derived from dividends from property, either in the 
    Funds, or in bank for East India Company’s stock.
    </dd>
    <dt>3.</dt>
    <dd>All persons paying income or assessed taxes to the yearly income of 40s.
    </dd>
    <dt>4.</dt>
    <dd>All graduates of any university in the United Kingdom.
    </dd>
    <dt>5.</dt>
    <dd>All persons who, for three years, have had a deposit of £50 in a savings’ bank.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c010'>So there is an end at once of property
and occupancy as the basis of the
electoral franchise. If you have five
sons, and wish to qualify them for
voting, you have simply to deposit
£50 in name of each in a savings’
bank, and in three years’ time they
will be placed on the register. And
remark this, that, once on the register,
there they abide for ever; for Lord
John distinctly tells us, “we make the
register of votes final.” So that, on
the day after your son is placed on
the roll, you may reclaim your money
with interest! Happy graduates of
universities! They are entitled to
the franchise in virtue of the magical
letters appended to their names;
and they may flit about from place
to place, the adornment of twenty
registers, because the register is to be
final. Take out a game-certificate,
and you may not only shoot partridges
for the year, but may vote at elections
in perpetuity! Any person who
wears hair-powder, keeps a terrier,
and has a crest engraved on his seal,
for which valuable privileges he pays
£2, 8s. 8d. of assessed taxes, is henceforward
a voter! We are not joking.
Such are absolutely the provisions of
this precious Reform Bill, the result,
as we are told, of the deliberate and
collective wisdom of the Ministry!</p>

<p class='c010'>Faintly, and like a dream, the recollection
of the beautiful old Whig
moral sentiments steals upon our
memory. We remember the touching
pictures, limned some twenty years
ago, of the industrious man working
his way to the rank of the ten-pounders,
in order to attain the glorious
privilege of the franchise. We
were told then that it was most desirable
to have a distinct property
qualification, in order that men
might exert themselves to attain it,
and by their exertions stimulate
others in the like course of frugality
and perseverance. Is that to be the
case in future? Certainly not. Every
common carrier who pays for his van
£2, 6s. 8d. yearly, as the tax on an implement
of trade, is to be as politically
powerful as the acred squire, or the
manufacturer who gives employment
to thousands—every horse-dealer, dog-breaker,
and tavern-keeper may vote
in virtue of the assessed taxes—every
clerk in a shop who has £100 a-year,
and every warehouseman, who has
either saved or succeeded to £50—are
to be entitled to vote either in
town or county. We said, long ago,
when the Whigs were lauding their
earlier measure as a grand incentive
to industry, and as a splendidly devised
scheme for stimulating deserving
operatives, that before many
years were over the same party
would attempt to lower the qualification,
so as to embrace all who were
likely to forward and promote their
designs. Our prophecy is now demonstrated
to be true. We showed
that, after the first successful attempt,
there never can be an end of swamping,
or, at all events, of proposals to
swamp. The ten-pound householders,
then in the full enjoyment of their
monopoly, did not seem to believe us.
Somehow or other they had been
impressed with the idea that the
Whigs were the devoted friends of
the “middle classes”—that they had
a firm faith in what was termed
“shopocracy”—and that they never
would attempt to supplant the power
which they had created. And, certainly,
the ten-pounders have done
nothing to merit this treatment at
the hands of the Whigs. They have
clung to them, especially in the large
towns, with a fidelity which we cannot
but respect, and, in spite of occasional
scurvy treatment, have shown
themselves the most zealous of partisans.
But the time has now arrived
when their ascendancy is to give
way. Respectability is no longer the
fashion. If the ten-pounders, indeed,
had been able to give the Whigs a
large majority in Parliament, and to
have insured their continuance in
power, matters might have been different.
There would then have been
no occasion for lowering the franchise;
because the Whigs, ever since they
have been a party (which is now an
old story), have never taken a single
step except as means towards an end;
and they would not, but for party
necessity, have attempted to swamp
their friends. But the old Reform
Bill, though devised especially for
the purpose of securing to the
Whigs an unlimited range of power,
did not succeed in its object. It
was based essentially upon property,
and, by degrees, property and Conservatism
came to a common understanding.
The Whigs lost ground
every year: partly because their
champions were either effete or insincere;
partly because they were foolish
enough to presume on their new
ascendancy, and to insult the rooted
Protestantism of the country; and
partly, because they showed themselves
in their arrangements grasping,
greedy, and nepotical, to a degree
never yet paralleled even in a corrupted
state. They wanted to make,
and did in fact make, with scarce an
exception, the Cabinet a mere family
Junta. They married and forwarded
marriages on the strength of political
connexion, and jobbed out public employment
accordingly. Grey, Russell,
and Elliot, were the three names preferred;
and Heaven only knows what
amount of perquisites was absorbed
by the scions of these illustrious races.
Such things cannot be done in a
corner, so secretly as to escape observation.
The popular ire was roused
at such an exhibition of awful selfishness,
and the Whigs declined in
character. Had Sir Robert Peel not
been the Minister and type of expediency,
he might have gained an easy
and lasting victory over them; but
unfortunately, both for the party
which he then led and for himself,
he had a weak perception of principle.
The two rivals sate, on opposite sides
of the table, watching each other at
the game of popularity, but never
for a moment reflecting that, in any
event, Great Britain had to pay the
loss. The game, though it had
continued a great deal too long,
was somewhat abruptly terminated.
Those who had supported the Baronet
while he played fair, withdrew
their confidence; and the noble
lord was left in possession of the
field. Did he maintain it? By no
means. He juggled and traversed
until every one was weary of him,
and at last he was ejected. The
election of 1852 showed that parties
were very nearly balanced; so nearly
indeed that, but for the union of the
Peelites with the Whigs, Lord Derby
would have had a majority in the
House of Commons. This state of
things may be embarrassing to politicians,
but it does not justify a violent
change in the Constitution. However
desirable majorities may be to either
party, an attempt to obtain ascendancy
by means of legislative enactment and
tampering with the franchise, is so
very reprehensible that it amounts
almost to a crime.</p>

<p class='c010'>But we must not lose sight of the
bill by indulging in remarks upon the
past. Its object is to swamp the present
class of voters by a wholesale admission
of others who have not been
able to raise themselves to the enviable
level which is the limit of the existing
qualification. The bill is ingeniously
devised. Let it pass, and every
tradesman will consider himself sure
of three or four votes which he can
direct. Because, of course, the clerk,
with £100 a-year, dares not vote
against his master; and, even if he is
entitled, after dismissal, to remain on
the register, the mere privilege of voting,
perhaps once in seven years, will
be a poor compensation for the immediate
loss of employment. Can you
call a clerk or book-keeper, with a
bare £100 a-year, independent? To
do so is a mere perversion of terms.
He is more liable even than the operative
to the influence of his employer,
inasmuch as the nature of his employment
is more precarious. We heard
a great deal last year about Government
influence being used among the
persons employed in the dockyards,
and it was gravely proposed by some
of the leading Whig journals, that all
such should be disfranchised, as they
could not be expected to vote independently.
But a Government official,
however zealous and unscrupulous
he may be, is amenable to public
opinion and public censure, and cannot
exercise the same stringent means
of compulsion which are open to the
tradesman or the attorney.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then as to bribery: the tendency
of lowering the franchise must be to
increase that to a very great extent.
In many places, even under the present
system, votes are bought and
sold; but if this bill is carried into
effect, the corruption will become
enormous. Experience has shown us,
very clearly, that there is a large class
in this country by whom votes are
considered in the light of marketable
commodities, and this bill seems specially
framed for the purpose of adding
to their numbers. The possession
of £50 in a savings-bank is by no
means a guarantee that the depositor
will be inaccessible to the influences
of a bribe. But besides the other
changes which we have discussed, it
is proposed that residence of two
years and a-half in a house rated at
£6 in a municipal borough shall
confer the right of voting, and that
previous payment of rates and taxes
is to be no longer required! Can any
one for a moment doubt that the consequence
of this will be to render constituencies
venal to an extent never
yet known in this country? If even
under the present system it is found
that bribery prevails, will not the
offence become much more rank and
general when you enfranchise a class
peculiarly liable from their position to
such influences? And remember this,
that candidates or their agents are not
always, nor indeed in the majority of
cases, the tempters. Enough has been
revealed to show us that, in a very large
number of the English towns, there
exist regularly organised clubs or societies
of voters, who force their terms
upon candidates. These fine patriots
do not concern themselves much with
party politics. They do not object to
one man because he is a Tory, or to
another because he is a Whig. Pledges
as to future conduct are not at all in
their line: they much prefer the immediate
tender of a crisp bank-note
or of a few shining sovereigns. They
have their agents and their office-bearers,
and must be bought in the
lump. Let this bill pass, and there
will hardly be an urban constituency
in this kingdom without such a club.
Is that a state of things to be envied?
Is it fair to the honest and upright
voter that he should be swamped by
organised rascality, and that his privilege
should be rendered of no avail?
We can hardly express ourselves too
strongly on this subject, for the provocation
is very great. The Whig
party, for years past, have affected to
mourn over the corruption of the constituencies,
and yet here is their accredited
leader bringing in a bill which
must necessarily have the effect of increasing
that corruption tenfold!</p>

<p class='c010'>But we have not yet quite done.
Lord John Russell proposes to give
46 new members to the English
counties; but then the county constituency
is not to remain as before.
Occupiers, not proprietors, of
£10 a-year are to have votes in counties;
and it is by no means contemplated
that the house occupied by
the voter should be of that value.
“We propose,” said Lord John Russell,
“with respect to the county
right of voting, that—with the exception
of a dwelling-house, which may
be of any value, provided the voter
lives in it—in all other cases the
building must be of the value of £5
a-year. Supposing there is a house
and land, the house may be rated
at £1 or £2 a-year, provided the
voter resides in it; but if the qualification
is made out by any other
building—a cattle-shed or any other
building of that kind—then we propose
this check, that such building
shall be of the value of £5 a-year.
This, then, is the franchise we propose
to give in counties for the
future; and the House will see that
it has a very considerable bearing
upon the question of the increase of
number of members which I have
stated we propose. Out of the whole
number I have mentioned I shall
propose that 46 members shall be
given to counties; but as these
counties will hereafter include the
£10 householders, it is obvious that
the constituency will be less of a
special character. It does seem to
me that all the endeavours made to
run down the agricultural interest,
or to run down the manufacturing interest,
are totally foolish and absurd,
and that there can be no better
system of representation than that
which takes into consideration the
whole of the great interests of the
country, which contribute to its glory
and prosperity.” We have thought
it right to insert these paragraphs,
because they contain a doctrine quite
new to statesmen, and one which has
hitherto been unbroached. There is
certainly a little obscurity in the
language, but not enough to conceal
the true nature of the sentiment.
What Lord John Russell means to
say is this:—It is absurd any longer
to maintain the special character of
constituencies—absurd to make distinctions
between agriculture, manufactures,
or any branch of industry—absurd
to frame your system so that
one member shall represent agriculture,
another commerce, and another
manufactures, because you should
in every case combine the whole of
the great interests of the country.
Carry that doctrine into effect, and
the distinction between counties and
towns ceases altogether. But how
can you bring it fairly into effect? In
the towns which have the privilege of
returning members, agriculture is not,
and cannot be, represented at all. The
urban voters are all engaged in other
pursuits, and they send to the House
of Commons members to represent
that branch of industry which is their
staple. From the towns, therefore,
the territorial interest, which is in
reality the greatest and most enduring
in England, never can be adequately
represented. You may, however,
easily enough, swamp the agricultural
interest in the counties, and that by
the method which Lord John Russell
proposes, namely, of admitting to the
county-roll ten-pound occupiers from
the towns, which do not send a representative
to Parliament. It has often
been remarked, as a special defect in
the Act of 1832, that it allowed in
many cases the votes of small proprietors
in villages and towns to
swamp the votes of the agriculturists;
and in several counties in Scotland
this is notoriously the case. The
manufacturing towns in Forfarshire,
in Roxburghshire, and in Fife, furnish
so many votes, that the landed interest
is entirely unrepresented; and
as new seats of manufacture are laid
down, the evil is always progressive.
There can be no doubt that in the instances
which we have referred to,
the landed interest is incomparably
greater than all the others; and yet,
in so far as representation goes, it has
virtually no voice at all. It has been
proposed, more than once—and the
scheme carries reason with it—that
these anomalies should be removed by
the attachment of the unrepresented
boroughs to the nearest ones which
have representation; thus increasing
and consolidating a class of voters who
have a distinct common interest. If
this were done, and the counties freed
from an incubus, there might be no
objection to the lowering of the agricultural
tenant’s qualification, so that
the man who paid £20 of yearly rent
might be entitled to admission to the
roll. But Lord John Russell takes
exactly the opposite view. He wants
to swamp the country constituencies
altogether, and he proposes to effect
that by letting in every man from the
villages who pays £10 of rent! He
himself admits that by this arrangement,
persons occupying houses not
rated at more than £1 or £2 a-year—in
fact, mere hovels—may become
county voters, and this he considers a
fitting method of combining “the
whole of the great interests of the
country!” And yet, mark his inconsistency.
By the same bill which proposes
this amalgamation of interests in
the counties, it is provided that University
representation shall be extended,
and that special members shall
be allotted to the English Inns of Court.
Surely there cannot be a more direct
recognition of separate and exclusive
interests than this; and yet, in counties,
the agricultural interest is to be
put down.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have not the least fear that the
law will be so altered; but that such
proposals should emanate from a Ministry,
is, we think, a disgraceful and a
lamentable fact. They are no doubt
entitled to have their opinion. They
may think, though on what grounds
we cannot divine, that it is good
policy not to maintain any balance in
the constitution, and that the franchise
in town and country should be made
the same. They may consider it advisable
that small manufacturing towns,
too unimportant to return members
of themselves, should be allowed to
furnish the majority of county voters,
and that, virtually, the land should
cease to have any representatives. If
they think so, it is much to be regretted
that they do not say so openly,
so that we might have the opportunity
of doing battle in a fair field.
But this measure of theirs is intended
to be deceptive, and convey a
false impression that they are dealing
impartially with all classes. In
the first place, they take from the
smaller boroughs no fewer than 66
members. Their principle is, that no
borough having less than 300 electors,
or less than 5000 inhabitants, ought
to return a member; and that no
borough having less than 500 electors,
or less than 10,000 inhabitants, should
return two members. Let us, for the
sake of argument, admit the justice
of this proposition. Does it therefore
follow that it was wise to disfranchise
such boroughs? That is by no means
a necessary consequence. If the constituency
is at present too small, extend
it by all means. Wherever practicable,
join these boroughs together;
where that cannot be done, take an
increased constituency from the
nearest unrepresented town, until you
reach the magic number which is to
be the minimum of representation.
Bring in fresh blood, which it is quite
easy to do, without exciting the clamour
and dissatisfaction which the
abolition or curtailment of a privilege
long enjoyed is sure to create. It
cannot be denied that there is plenty
of material at hand. There is also
Parliamentary precedent and usage;
for in Scotland, at the present moment,
groups of small burghs return a
single member, and some of these
burghs are infinitesimally small. We
have them so low, in point of voters,
as 12, 14, and 22. Yet they are not
disfranchised. They share their peculiar
privilege along with others,
making in the aggregate very respectable
constituencies. Surely such an
arrangement as that would be preferable
to the Government proposition,
which does wanton violence to
constituencies against which no accusation
has been made. We fear,
however, that the disfranchisement
of the smaller boroughs was considered
an indispensable preliminary
to the grand attack upon the counties.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having thus secured the disposal of
sixty-six seats, the Government come
forward with an immense show of
liberality, and offer forty-six of these
to the counties. But then it is only
on condition that the counties will
allow themselves to be swamped.
Nine large towns are each to have an
additional member; there are to be
five new borough seats; the Inns of
Court are to have two, and the London
University one member; the remaining
three seats are to be given to
Scotland.</p>

<p class='c010'>This brings us to a point which we
are absolutely bound to notice, because
it serves as a further illustration
of the impropriety and folly of bringing
forward such a bill at such a time.
If the Emperor Nicholas had the direction
of our internal affairs, he could
not have devised a more notable plan
for fomenting dissension among us;
and it is but right to show that this
measure, if pushed on, must excite an
angry feeling in the country. We,
who are opposing any change in the
electoral franchise at the present time,
mainly because we think it an unhappy
and dangerous juncture for making experiments,
cannot be blamed if we
state our own views of what is really
required when the proper time shall
arrive for making a readjustment of
the representation. We do not wish,
by any means, to argue the question
at present: we state it simply to
show the extent of the disagreement
which may arise, if this measure is
to be prosecuted just now.</p>

<p class='c010'>Independent of the wholesale disfranchisement
of English boroughs,
which must necessarily excite great
disgust and dissatisfaction, we take
leave to tell Lord John Russell, and
the other members of the Cabinet,
that this bill of theirs is not likely to
meet with any favour in the eyes of the
Scottish people. The question of adequate
representation has been mooted,
discussed, and is now thoroughly understood
by us; and we are determined,
in the event of a change, to
insist that our rights shall be recognised
and allowed. This new bill,
proposing to give us three additional
members, whereas in respect either
of population or of taxation we are
entitled to twenty, cannot be satisfactory.
It is not only right, but
necessary, that our English friends
should know the feeling in Scotland.
We are not represented on the same
scale or in the same manner as England
is, and we complain of the inequality.
We ask a common standard
and a just proportion. Now, it does
not appear that, by the present bill,
the existing anomalies are to be removed,
although, by the disfranchisement
of so many boroughs, it would
have been easy to have given Scotland
her just share of members. If
there be any reason why Scotland
should have fewer proportional representatives
than England, let it be
boldly stated. If there is no reason
at all, then let justice be done to us.
We do not wish at present to go into
details—indeed, that would be premature,
until the new Scottish Reform
Bill is before us; but as it is quite
plain that the aggregate number of
the House of Commons is not to be
augmented, and as Lord John Russell
proposes to give only three additional
members to Scotland, we are perfectly
entitled to enter our emphatic protest
against a measure which has no solid
principle for its foundation. The first
point for consideration, in a redistribution
of the representation such as is
now contemplated, was undoubtedly
the number of members which England,
Scotland, and Ireland are entitled
respectively to return. Lord John
Russell either does not see the principle,
or he refuses to acknowledge it.
Now, this is a matter which will cause
much excitement, and create not a
little angry feeling in Scotland; and
it is as well that our English friends
should be made aware of it. We
are, of course, anxious for a proper
increase of national representatives,
and we are perfectly aware that we
cannot attain that object without a
general measure for altering and abolishing
constituencies. But this measure,
while it is sure to create a turmoil
in England, hardly professes to
benefit us at all, and avoids the principle
for which the Scottish people are
contending. Any arrangements which
may be made as to the future distribution
of the representation, ought to
be well weighed, considered, and matured;
for this country will not submit
to the confusion of a new reform
bill once in every three or four years.
This measure seems to us to be utterly
deficient in these respects, and to be
so loosely conceived as to give some
colour to the prevalent opinion that it
furnished an agreeable relaxation to
the noble Lord between the intervals
of his more serious editorial labours.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Scotland, therefore, the bill will
be considered highly objectionable, as
evading the only popular demand
from that portion of Great Britain.
Beyond an increase of numbers, we
have no desire for any change—Whigs,
Tories, and Radicals, being
for once agreed.</p>

<p class='c010'>But we are not so unreasonable as to
wish to fight that battle now. We earnestly
deprecate anything like internal
discord, for we have other battles
to fight, and the people of Great Britain
ought now, if ever, to be cordially
united in sentiment. Therefore, although
we think that we are not altogether
fairly treated, and that we
have not only a strong case, but an
absolute right to claim redress, we
shall not be guilty of the lamentable
folly of urging our claims for increased
representation at such a time. We
believe that to be the general feeling
of the people of Scotland; but then
their forbearance is entirely contingent
upon the course which the Government
may pursue in respect to this
measure. There may be, and probably
will be, agitation hereafter; but
there need be none now, at least on
the score of representation, if the
Ministry will but tacitly acknowledge
their error, and remove this source of
dissension.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are several other points in
this bill which are not only open to
comment, but, as we think, decidedly
objectionable. We shall merely refer
to two of these. The first is, the preposterous
notion of giving a member
to minorities. The more we consider
this plan, the more egregiously absurd
does it appear. Why, in the
name of all that is rational, should
minorities be represented? And if
that question can be answered satisfactorily,
there is still another beyond
it:—Why should only a limited number
of constituencies be put in possession
of such a privilege? But it may
be worth while to suppose the new
system in operation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Manchester, under the new bill, will
have three members. At present it
has two, and these two are Liberals.
On the hypothesis of Lord John Russell,
though that by no means follows
as a matter of course, the third, or
minority member, will be a Conservative.
What does that amount to
but the cancelling, on any great political
occasion, of two of the members
for Manchester? The Conservative
pairs off with one of the Liberals, or
they go into the opposite lobby, which
is exactly the same thing, and the
opinions of Cottonopolis are only represented
and enforced on a division,
by a single member! We suspect that
the present electorate of Manchester
is much too shrewd and far-sighted to
accept any arrangement of the kind;
and that they would much prefer having
two members whose votes tell on
each division, to having nominally
three, but, in reality, only one. Suppose
that a minority member dies
during a session of Parliament, or accepts
the Chiltern Hundreds, how is
his place to be supplied? Is there to
be an election with three candidates
in the field, and is the lowest to be
proclaimed the victor? If not, what
becomes of Lord John Russell’s “principle?”
Then observe that, setting
aside its absurdity, this crotchet would
establish a new relation between representatives
and represented. At present,
the choice of the majority is recognised
by all, and in matters of business
there is free communication between
the electors and the member, irrespective
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>altogether of their party tendencies.
This is a great privilege, and
a great advantage. It has done much
to soften acerbity, and, in some instances,
has reconciled powerful parties
to acquiesce in the return of a good
and energetic member, albeit he might
support a different policy from that
to which they were inclined. But
now the majority is to have its members,
and the minority is to have its
member, and the House is to be
divided against itself. We seriously
aver that we do not remember to have
ever heard of a proposal more singularly
silly, or more utterly absurd;
and if this really be, as we are told,
the keystone of the New Reform Bill,
we may be allowed to express a hope
that Lord John Russell will, for the
future, desist from all architectural
experiments.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have barely space or time to
advert to one other portion of this
Bill—namely, that whereby it is proposed
that members accepting office
under the Crown should not vacate
their seats. So far from being inclined
to approve of that proposition, we
condemn it utterly. The existing rule
is a safeguard, and a most valuable
one, against profligacy in high places,
and ought not, by any means, to be
abolished. It is rather amusing to
see that Lord John Russell has been
compelled to reflect upon his own
measure of 1832, in order to make a
rational excuse for his new proposal.
He says—“In those times, when a
seat could always be found for any
person for whom it was required,
Ministers suffered little inconvenience
from the Act of Anne; but when the
principle of popular representation
was introduced into all our elections,
the statute created difficulties which
were hardly compensated by the advantage
of having new elections.”
What difficulties? There were no
difficulties of any kind. If an honest
man, with a clear conscience, who
was the choice of a constituency,
accepted office, he was sure to be returned
again, and almost always
without opposition; if, on the contrary,
his conscience was not quite
clear, he had to undergo a wholesome
ordeal. But perhaps we owe this
proposal to the clause about the
minority members, since it is plain
that an unfortunate senator in that
position need not go down to his constituency
unless, as we have already
said, provision is made for his being
returned, in virtue of his being lowest
on the poll.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whether the Ministry collectively
have acted wisely or not in allowing
this measure to be brought forward,
we cannot say. They may have
reasons which are not apparent to us.
They may, for example, wish to allow
Lord John Russell to expose himself,
preparatory to some new arrangement.
He is evidently a dangerous
member of the Cabinet; for, while
the Prime Minister is maintaining that
there is still a chance of avoiding war
with Russia, it is intolerable that a
subordinate should use language of
the most unguarded and opprobrious
nature in respect to the Emperor. It
is just a repetition of the offence of
which both Sir James Graham and
Sir Charles Wood were guilty in respect
of Louis Napoleon; and although,
in this case, the commentary
may be just enough, we cannot but
deplore such exhibitions on the part
of Ministers. But if the Ministry
intend seriously to proceed with this
bill, at the present time, we shall be
compelled to draw upon the noble
lord, for terms sufficiently severe to
express our indignation at their
conduct.</p>

how entirely they anticipated the views of Mr Stuart, and how much they were alive
to the necessity of such a movement as that which Mr Stuart has been instrumental
in originating. “I would add,” writes one clergyman, “that as the moral condition
of frail beings such as we are is often powerfully affected by circumstances of comparatively
trifling amount, if masters attended a little to the physical comforts of
their servants, by providing them with fire and light, &#38;c., (when they live in bothies),
by means of a female servant, having their room in readiness when they leave off work,
instead of allowing them to go to a bothy, cold and comfortless, they would be less
induced to resort to ardent spirits, or to wander from home in search of company and
comfort.” Another reverend respondent says: “The greatest desideratum in respect
of this class, and which would tend more than any other temporal means to their
improvement, is the adoption by the landed proprietors and by agricultural societies
of the plan of rewarding servants of long-established good character, by affording
them facilities for becoming occupiers of small farms themselves.”</p>
